<b>Current issues:</b> Years of civil strife have destroyed much of Liberia's economic infrastructure,
made civil administration nearly impossible, and brought economic activity
virtually to a halt. The deterioration of economic conditions has been greatly
exacerbated by the flight of most business people with their expertise and
capital. Civil order ended in 1990 when President Samuel Kenyon DOE was killed
by rebel forces. In April 1996, when forces loyal to faction leaders Charles
Ghankay TAYLOR and Alhaji KROMAH attacked rival ethnic Krahn factions, the
fighting further damaged Monrovia's dilapidated infrastructure. Fighting waned
in late May 1996, allowing West African peacekeepers to regain control of
Monrovia. The Abuja II peace accord was signed in August 1996 replacing the
Chairman of the ruling Council of State, Wilton SANKAWULO, with Ruth PERRY.
National elections were scheduled for 30 May 1997, but long-term prospects
for peace will remain poor unless the warring factions can overcome their
greed, mutual suspicions and ethnic hatreds.

<b>Economy - overview:</b> Civil war since 1990 has destroyed much of Liberia's economy, especially
the infrastructure in and around Monrovia. Businessmen have fled the country,
taking capital and expertise with them. Many will not return. Richly endowed
with water, mineral resources, forests and a climate favorable to agriculture,
Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic products, while local manufacturing,
mainly foreign owned, had been small in scope. Political and economic instability
- including the stripping of resources by local warlords - threatens prospects
for reconstruction as well as the repatriation of an estimated 750,000 Liberian
refugees who have fled to neighboring countries. The continued political turmoil
has prevented restoration of normal economic life, including the re-establishment
of a strong central government with effective economic development programs.
