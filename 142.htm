<b>Current issues:</b> Lebanon has made progress toward rebuilding its political institutions
and regaining its national sovereignty since the end of the devastating 16-year
civil war, which began in 1975. Under the Ta'if Accord - the blueprint for
national reconciliation - the Lebanese have established a more equitable political
system, particularly by giving Muslims a greater say in the political process.
Since the end of the civil war, the Lebanese have formed five cabinets and
conducted two legislative elections. Most of the militias have been weakened
or disbanded. The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) has seized vast quantities of
weapons used by the militias during the war and extended central government
authority over about one-half of the country. Hizballah, the radical Shi'a
party, retains most of its weapons. Foreign forces still occupy areas of Lebanon.
Israel maintains troops in southern Lebanon and continues to support a proxy
militia, the Army of South Lebanon (ASL), along a narrow stretch of territory
contiguous to its border. The ASL's enclave encompasses this self-declared
security zone and about 20 kilometers north to the strategic town of Jazzin.
Syria maintains about 30,000 troops in Lebanon. These troops are based mainly
in Beirut, North Lebanon, and the Bekaa Valley. Syria's deployment was legitimized
by the Arab League during Lebanon's civil war and in the Ta'if accord. Citing
the continued weakness of the LAF, Beirut's requests, and failure of the Lebanese
Government to implement all of the constitutional reforms in the Ta'if accord,
Damascus has so far refused to withdraw its troops from Lebanon.

<b>Economy - overview:</b> The 1975-91 civil war seriously damaged Lebanon's economic infrastructure,
cut national output by half, and all but ended Lebanon's position as a Middle
Eastern entrepot and banking hub. Peace has enabled the central government
to restore control in Beirut, begin collecting taxes, and regain access to
key port and government facilities. Economic recovery has been helped by a
financially sound banking system and resilient small- and medium-scale manufacturers,
with family remittances, banking services, manufactured and farm exports,
and international aid as the main sources of foreign exchange. Lebanon's economy
has made impressive gains since Prime Minister HARIRI launched his $18 billion
"Horizon 2000" reconstruction program in 1993. Real GDP grew 8% in 1994 and
7% in 1995 before Israel's Operation Grapes of Wrath in April 1996 stunted
economic activity. During 1992-96, annual inflation fell from more than 170%
to 10%, and foreign exchange reserves jumped to more than $4 billion from
$1.4 billion. Burgeoning capital inflows have fueled foreign payments surpluses,
and the Lebanese pound has remained relatively stable. Progress also has been
made in rebuilding Lebanon's war-torn physical and financial infrastructure.
Solidere, a $2-billion firm, is managing the reconstruction of Beirut's central
business district, the stock market reopened in January 1996, and international
banks and insurance companies are returning. The government nonetheless faces
serious challenges in the economic arena. The government has had to fund reconstruction
by tapping foreign exchange reserves and boosting borrowing. The stalled peace
process and ongoing violence in southern Lebanon could spawn wider hostilities
that would disrupt vital capital inflows. Furthermore, the gap between rich
and poor has widened since HARIRI took office, sowing grassroots dissatisfaction
over the skewed distribution of reconstruction's benefits and leading the
government to shift its focus from rebuilding infrastructure to improving
social conditions.
