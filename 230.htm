<p>
<b>Economy - overview:</b> The economy is dominated by the bauxite industry, which accounts for
upwards of 15% of GDP and more than 65% of export earnings. Following a dismal
year in 1994 which saw the value of the Surinamese currency plummet by about
80%, inflation rise to more than 600%, and national output fall for the fifth
consecutive year, nearly all economic indicators improved in 1995-96. The
government unified the exchange rate and maintained a fairly tight monetary
policy. Inflation apparently has been eliminated, and tax revenues have increased
sufficiently to erase the budget deficit. The release of substantial development
aid from the Netherlands - which had been held up due to the government's
failure to initiate economic reforms - also has helped buoy the economy. Suriname's
economic prospects for the medium term will depend on continued implementation
of economic restructuring. The new government elected in the fall of 1996
has sent mixed signals about commitment to these reforms.
