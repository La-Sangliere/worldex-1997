<b>Economy - overview:</b> The state plays the primary role in the economy and controls practically
all foreign trade. The government has undertaken several reforms in recent
years to stem excess liquidity, increase labor incentives, and alleviate serious
shortages of food, consumer goods, and services. The liberalized agricultural
markets introduced in October 1994, at which state and private farmers sell
above-quota production at unrestricted prices, have broadened legal consumption
alternatives and reduced black market prices. Government efforts to lower
subsidies to unprofitable enterprises and to shrink the money supply caused
the peso's black market value to move from a peak of 120 to the dollar in
the summer of 1994 to a low of 18-20 to the dollar in late September before
climbing to 20-21 at the end of 1996. New taxes helped drive down the number
of legally registered self-employed workers from 208,000 in January 1996 to
180,000 by December. Havana announced in 1995 that GDP declined by 35% during
1989-1993, the result of lost Soviet aid and domestic inefficiencies. The
drop in GDP apparently halted in 1994, when Cuba reported a 0.7% growth. Government
officials claimed that GDP increased by 2.5% in 1995 and 7.8% in 1996. Export
earnings rose an estimated 40% in 1996 to $2.1 billion, largely on the strength
of increased sugar shipments to Russia and higher nickel production through
a joint venture with a Canadian firm. With the economic recovery, imports
rose for the second straight year, growing by an estimated 26% to $3.5 billion.
 Living standards for the average Cuban, however, have not improved significantly.
