<b>Economy - overview:</b> Paraguay has a market economy marked by a large informal sector. The
informal sector features both reexport of imported consumer goods (electronics,
whiskeys, perfumes, cigarettes, and office equipment) to neighboring countries
as well as by the activities of thousands of microenterprises and urban street
vendors. The formal sector is largely oriented toward services, but a large
percentage of the population derive their living from agricultural activity,
often on a subsistence basis. The formal economy has grown an average of 3%
to 4% over the past five years. However, population has increased at 3% a
year over the same period, leaving per capita income nearly stagnant. The
WASMOSY government has continued to pursue its economic reform agenda - with
mixed success - in close coordination with its partners in Mercosur (Southern
Cone Common Market). Paraguay's ongoing integration into Mercosur offers potential
for investment and growth. Although GDP grew by only about 1.5% in 1996, it
is expected to grow at a higher rate in 1997.
