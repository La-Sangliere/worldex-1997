<p>
<b>Economy - overview:</b> One of the four West European trillion-dollar economies, the French
economy features considerable state control over its capitalistic market system.
In running important industrial segments (railways, airlines, electricity,
telecommunications), administering an exceptionally generous social welfare
system, and staffing an enormous bureaucracy, the state spends about 55% of
GDP. France has substantial agricultural resources and a diversified modern
 industrial sector. Large tracts of fertile land, the application of modern
technology, and subsidies have combined to make it the leading agricultural
producer in Western Europe. Largely self-sufficient in agricultural products,
France is a major exporter of wheat and dairy products. The industrial sector
generates about one-quarter of GDP, and the growing services sector has become
crucial to the economy. Following stagnation and recession in 1991-93, French
GDP expanded 2.4% in 1994 and in 1995 but at only 1.3% in 1996. Persistently
high unemployment still poses a major problem for the government, as will
the need to cut back on government spending to keep the economy internationally
competitive and enable France to qualify for European Economic and Monetary
Union, slated to introduce a common European currency in January 1999. The
government also has laid plans to sell off much of its stake in the telecommunications
and defense industries in 1997 as part of its bid to make domestic companies
more competitive with foreign rivals. However, the socialist victory at the
 polls in June 1997 casts doubt on France's future policy toward economic
union and privatization of domestic economic activity.
