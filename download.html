<H2>Printing and Downloading Tips</H2>
<HR>
<P>
The 1997 version of the World Factbook is in a different format from last year.  This year we are combining the flag, map and country descriptions in one compact file with resolutions readable to the average browser. 



<P>
The World Factbook appears on your screen in two windows or frames. The left frame is the contents window that allows you to navigate throughout the Factbook and find the country, appendix, or reference map you wish to locate; the right frame is the file you linked to when you clicked on it in the contents window. 



<P>
To <B>print</B> text or graphics you must do the following:

<P>
<LI>After clicking in the window you wish to print, go to your Print option, click on Print, and the contents of the window will print. 
<P>
