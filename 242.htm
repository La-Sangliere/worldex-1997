<b>Economy - overview:</b> Trinidad and Tobago has earned a reputation as an excellent investment
site for international businesses. Successful economic reforms implemented
in 1995 are expected to bring an average growth rate of 2% over the next three
 years, and foreign investment and trade are flourishing. Unemployment - a
main cause of the country's socio-economic problems - is high, but has decreased
to its lowest point in five years. The country enjoys a healthy trade surplus
of $500 million, yet its heavy dependence on oil and petrochemical prices
makes its trade balance vulnerable to sudden shifts. Furthermore, Caricom,
Trinidad and Tobago's main market, is saturated, provoking some countries
to establish non-tariff trade barriers.
