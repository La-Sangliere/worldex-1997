<b>Economy - overview:</b> The hydrocarbons sector is the backbone of the economy, accounting for
roughly 57% of government revenues, 25% of GDP, and almost all export earnings;
Algeria has the fifth-largest reserves of natural gas in the world and is
the second largest gas exporter; and it ranks fourteenth for oil reserves.
Algiers' efforts to reform one of the most centrally planned economies in
the Arab world began after the 1986 collapse of world oil prices plunged the
country into a severe recession. In 1989, the government launched a comprehensive,
IMF-supported program to achieve economic stabilization and to introduce market
mechanisms into the economy. Despite substantial progress toward economic
adjustment, in 1992 the reform drive stalled as Algiers became embroiled in
political turmoil. In September 1993, a new government was formed, and one
priority was the resumption and acceleration of the structural adjustment
process. Buffeted by the slump in world oil prices and burdened with a heavy
foreign debt, Algiers concluded a one-year standby arrangement with the IMF
in April 1994. Following a Paris Club debt rescheduling in 1995, a robust
harvest, and elevated oil prices, the economy experienced a strong recovery
and key economic improvements. Recent and planned investments in developing
hydrocarbon resources are likely to increase growth and export earnings.
