<b>Economy - overview:</b> Morocco faces the typical problems of developing countries - restraining
government spending, reducing constraints on private activity and foreign
 trade, and keeping inflation within manageable bounds. Since the early 1980s
the government has pursued an economic program toward these objectives with
the support of the IMF, the World Bank, and the Paris Club of creditors. The
dirham is now fully convertible for current account transactions; reforms
of the financial sector have been implemented; and 43 state enterprises have
been privatized. Drought conditions in three of the last four years have depressed
activity in the key agricultural sector, holding down exports and contributing
to a 7.5% contraction in real GDP in 1995. Favorable rainfall in 1996 nurtured
a record wheat crop and contributed to the 9% overall growth. Servicing the
large external debt, preparing the economy for freer trade with the European
Union, and finding jobs for Morocco's youthful population remain long-term
problems.
