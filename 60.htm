<p>
<b>Economy - overview:</b> The economy of Democratic Republic of the Congo has continued to disintegrate,
although former Prime Minister KENGO had had some success in slowing the rate
of economic decline. While meaningful economic figures are difficult to come
by, the high rate of inflation, chronic large government deficits, and plunging
mineral production have made it one of the world's poorest countries. Most
formal transactions are conducted in hard currency as indigenous bank notes
have lost almost all value, and a barter economy now flourishes in all but
the largest cities. During the bitter civil strive of 1996-97 most individuals
and families have hung on grimly through subsistence farming and petty trade.
The new KABILA government will be hard pressed to meet its financial obligations
to the IMF or to put in place the financial measures advocated by it. Improved
political stability would boost the country's long-term potential to effectively
exploit its vast mineral and agricultural resources.
