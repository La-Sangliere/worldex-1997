<b>Economy - overview:</b> Since the establishment of the Slovak Republic on 1 January 1993, Slovakia
has continued the difficult transformation from a centrally controlled economy
to a modern market-oriented economy. Macroeconomic performance improved steadily
in 1994-96, but privatization progressed only in fits and starts. Strong export
performance boosted GDP growth to 4.8% in 1994 after a four-year decline.
GDP surged to 7.4% growth in 1995 and should be only slightly less in 1996,
the fastest growth in Central and Eastern Europe. Unemployment fell to about
12% in 1996 and inflation dropped from 26% in 1993 to 5.5% in 1996, the lowest
in the region. Foreign debt of $4.6 billion also is the lowest in the region
and the second lowest per capita. Private activity now makes up roughly two-thirds
of GDP. Positive international financial performance has led Standard &amp;
Poor's to raise its rating of the National Bank of Slovakia's foreign currency
debt to just one step below investment grade. Although Slovak economic performance
continues to be impressive, many warning signs of possible danger ahead have
been raised. Aggregate demand has surged in the form of increased personal
and government consumption. At the same time that the budget deficit is growing,
the money supply has been rapidly increasing, which could apply upward pressure
on inflation. The trade and current account deficits both are mounting as
imports soar and exports sag. Perhaps most troubling, Slovakia continues to
have difficulty attracting foreign investment because of perceived political
problems and halting progress on restructuring and privatization. The government
projects 6.4% growth in 1997 and 5% in 1998. Continuing economic recovery
in western Europe should boost exports and production, but Slovakia's image
with foreign creditors and investors could suffer setbacks in 1997 if progress
on privatization and restructuring stalls.
