<b>Economy - overview:</b> Mexico has a free market economy with a mixture of modern and outmoded
industry and agriculture, increasingly dominated by the private sector. The
Mexican economy enters 1997 in the midst of an economic recovery that began
to pick up steam in mid-1996. After plummeting more than 6% in 1995 in the
aftermath of the peso crisis, economic activity in Mexico grew by an estimated
5.1% in 1996. Many private forecasters who had scoffed at the ZEDILLO administration's
3% growth target for 1996 are now projecting economic expansion of 4-5% for
1997. Strong export growth continues to drive the economy; total exports were
up roughly 16% in 1996 compared to 1995. By the end of 1996, however, Mexican
government statistics showed that increased domestic consumption and investment
spending were also beginning to contribute to the recovery. Despite these
positive economic trends, structural problems and vulnerabilities remain.
Low savings rates will keep Mexico dependent on foreign capital; national
savings as a share of GDP plunged from a peak of 25% in 1983 to less than
14% in 1994. Additionally, Mexico City is still struggling to bail out a banking
sector burdened with bad debts. Mexico's international trade continues to
be highly dependent on the US market. The US/Mexico trade balance has shifted
over the last two years because of the peso's rapid devaluation in late 1994,
which made Mexican exports much more attractive. In 1995 and 1996, the US
ran trade deficits with Mexico, a large turnaround from 1994's trade surplus
of about $1.3 billion.
