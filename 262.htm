<b>Current issues:</b> The Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government
Arrangements ("the DOP"), signed in Washington on 13 September 1993, provides
for a transitional period not exceeding five years of Palestinian interim
self-government in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Permanent status negotiations
began on 5 May 1996. Under the DOP, Israel agreed to transfer certain powers
and responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority, which includes a Palestinian
Legislative Council elected in January 1996, as part of interim self-governing
arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A transfer of powers and responsibilities
for the Gaza Strip and Jericho has taken place pursuant to the Israel-PLO
4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area and in additional
areas of the West Bank pursuant to the Israel-PLO 28 September 1995 Interim
Agreement. The DOP provides that Israel will retain responsibility during
the transitional period for external security and for internal security and
public order of settlements and Israelis. Permanent status is to be determined
through direct negotiations which began on 5 May 1996.

<b>Economy - overview:</b> Economic progress in the West Bank has been hampered by tight Israeli
security restrictions. Industries using advanced technology or requiring sizable
investment have been discouraged by a lack of local capital and restrictive
Israeli policies. Capital investment consists largely of residential housing,
not productive assets that would enable local Palestinian firms to compete
with Israeli industry. GDP has been substantially supplemented by remittances
of workers employed in Israel. Such transfers from the Persian Gulf states
dropped after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. In the wake of the Persian
Gulf crisis, many Palestinians have returned to the West Bank, increasing
unemployment, and export revenues have dropped because of the decline of markets
in Jordan and the Gulf states. An estimated 147,000 people were in refugee
camps in 1996.
