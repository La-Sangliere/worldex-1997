<b>Economy - overview:</b> Chile has a prosperous, essentially free market economy. Civilian governments
- which took over from the military in March 1990 - have continued to reduce
the government's role in the economy while shifting the emphasis of public
spending toward social programs. Growth in real GDP averaged more than 6.5%
in 1991-1996, and inflation is nearing a 40-year low. Chile's currency and
foreign reserves also are strong, as sustained foreign capital inflows - driven
in part by state privatizations - have more than offset occasional current
account deficits and public debt buybacks. President FREI, who took office
in March 1994, has placed improving Chile's education system and developing
foreign export markets at the top of his economic agenda. Despite this progress,
the Chilean economy remains largely dependent on a few sectors - particularly
copper mining, fishing, and forestry. Success in meeting the government's
goal of sustained annual economic growth of 5% depends largely on world prices
for these commodities, continued foreign investor confidence, and the government's
ability to maintain a conservative fiscal stance. In 1996, Chile became an
associate member of Mercosur and concluded a Free Trade Agreement with Canada.
