<b>Economy - overview:</b> Argentina benefits from rich natural resources, a highly literate population,
an export-oriented agricultural sector, and a diversified industrial base.
Nevertheless, following decades of mismanagement and statist policies, the
economy in the late 1980s was plagued with huge external debts and recurring
bouts of hyperinflation. Elected in 1989, in the depths of recession, President
MENEM has implemented a comprehensive economic restructuring program that
shows signs of putting Argentina on a path of stable, sustainable growth.
Argentina's currency has traded at par with the US dollar since April 1991,
and inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 50 years. Argentines have
responded to price stability by repatriating capital and investing in domestic
industry. Growth averaged more than 8% between 1991 and 1994, then fell to
4.6% in 1995, largely in reaction to the Mexican peso crisis. The economy
grew at 4.4% in 1996, with the strongest growth occurring in the second half
of the year. Unemployment increased slightly - to over 17% - and Buenos Aires
was forced to renegotiate fiscal targets with the IMF. Although the economy
is expected to grow by at least 5% in 1997, unemployment and fiscal concerns
will continue to challenge the MENEM administration.
