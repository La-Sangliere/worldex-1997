<b>Economy - overview:</b> Australia has a prosperous Western-style capitalist economy, with a
per capita GDP above the levels in highly industrialized West European countries.
Rich in natural resources, Australia is a major exporter of agricultural products,
minerals, metals, and fossil fuels. Commodities account for about 60% of the
value of total exports, so that a downturn in world commodity prices can have
a big impact on the economy. The government is pushing for increased exports
of manufactured goods, but competition in international markets continues
to be severe. Australia has suffered from the low growth and high unemployment
characterizing the OECD countries in the early 1990s, but the economy has
expanded at reasonably steady rates in recent years. In addition to high unemployment,
short-term economic problems include a balancing of output growth and inflationary
pressures and the stimulation of exports to offset rising imports.
