<p>
<b>Economy - overview:</b> Sheltered from the pressures of the international marketplace for almost
three decades, Syria's predominantly statist economy is on a weak footing
because of Damascus's failure to implement extensive economic reform. After
an economic rebound in the early 1990s in the wake of the Persian Gulf war,
economic growth has slowed as the traditionally volatile economy has once
again slumped. Current account and budget deficits and inflation are increasing.
The dominant agricultural sector remains underdeveloped, with roughly 80%
of agricultural land still dependent on rain-fed sources. Although Syria has
sufficient water supplies in the aggregate at normal levels of precipitation,
the great distance between major water supplies and population centers poses
serious distribution problems, and the water problem is exacerbated by rapid
population growth, industrial expansion, and increased water pollution. Unemployment
remains a nagging problem because about 60% of the population is under the
age of 20, ensuring a steady flow of job seekers into the already tight labor
market. Private investment is critical to the modernization of the agricultural,
energy, and export sectors, particularly because Damascus is saddled with
a heavy foreign debt. Oil production is leveling off, and the efforts of the
nonoil sector to penetrate international markets have fallen short. Syria's
inadequate infrastructure, outmoded technological base, and weak educational
system hamper competition with neighbors such as Jordan and Israel. The dominant
public sector continues to be plagued by labor, financial, and management
problems, and much of the private sector is hobbled by a shortage of capital.
The economic benefits of any peace treaty with Israel will depend in large
part on the pace of economic reform.
