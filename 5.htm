<b>Economy - overview:</b> An extremely poor country by European standards, Albania is making the
difficult transition to a more open-market economy. The economy rebounded
in 1993-95 after a severe depression accompanying the collapse of the previous
centrally planned system in 1990 and 1991. However, a weakening of government
resolve to maintain stabilization policies in the election year of 1996 contributed
to renewal of inflationary pressures, spurred by the budget deficit which
exceeded 12%. The collapse of financial pyramid schemes in early 1997 - which
had attracted deposits from a substantial portion of Albania's adult population
- triggered unrest in much of the south in early 1997. The economy continues
to be buoyed by remittances of some 20% of the labor force which works abroad,
mostly in Greece and Italy. These remittances supplement GDP and help offset
the large foreign trade deficit. Most agricultural land was privatized in
1992, substantially improving peasant incomes. Overall economic performance
is likely to be substantially worse in 1997; inflation will easily top 50%
and GDP may drop by 5% or more.
