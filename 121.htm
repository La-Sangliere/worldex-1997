<b>Economy - overview:</b> The economy is small and trade dependent. Agriculture, once the most
important sector, is now dwarfed by industry, which accounts for 38% of GDP,
about 80% of exports, and employs 26% of the labor force. Although exports
remain the primary engine for Ireland's robust growth, the economy is also
benefiting from a rise in consumer spending and recovery in both construction
and business investment. Since the 1980s, inflation has fallen sharply and
chronic trade deficits have been transformed into annual surpluses. Unemployment
remains a serious problem, however, and job creation is the main focus of
government policy. To ease unemployment, Dublin aggressively courts foreign
investors and recently created a new industrial development agency to aid
small indigenous firms.
