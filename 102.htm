<b>Economy - overview:</b> The economy depends mainly on US military spending and on revenue generated
by the tourism industry. Over the past 20 years, the tourist industry has
grown rapidly, creating a construction boom for new hotels and the expansion
of older ones. More than one million tourists visit Guam each year. Most food
and industrial goods are imported, with about 75% from the US. Guam faces
the problem of building up the civilian economic sector to offset the impact
of military downsizing.
