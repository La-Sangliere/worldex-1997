<b>Population:</b> 6,590,325 (July 1997 est.) 
<br><i>note:</i> this estimate was derived from an official census taken in 1987 by the
Somali Government with the cooperation of the UN and the US Bureau of the
Census; population estimates are updated year by year between census years
by factoring growth rates into them and by taking account of refugee movements
and of losses due to famine; lower estimates of Somalia's population in mid-1996
(on the order of 6.0 million to 6.5 million) have been made by aid and relief
agencies, based on the number of persons being fed; population counting in
Somalia is complicated by the large numbers of nomads and by refugee movements
in response to famine and clan warfare

<b>Economy - overview:</b> One of the world's poorest and least developed countries, Somalia has
few resources. Moreover, much of the economy has been devastated by the civil
war. Agriculture is the most important sector, with livestock accounting for
about 40% of GDP and about 65% of export earnings. Nomads and seminomads,
who are dependent upon livestock for their livelihood, make up a large portion
of the population. Crop production generates only 10% of GDP and employs about
20% of the work force. The main export crop is bananas; sugar, sorghum, and
corn are grown for the domestic market. The small industrial sector is based
on the processing of agricultural products and accounts for less than 10%
of GDP; most facilities have been shut down because of the civil strife. The
greatly increased political turmoil of 1991-93 resulted in a substantial drop
in agricultural output, with widespread famine. In 1994 economic conditions
stabilized in the countryside, followed in 1995 by slight improvements. However,
ongoing civil strife in Mogadishu and outlying areas is interfering with any
substantial recovery.
