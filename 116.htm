<p>
<b>Economy - overview:</b> India's economy is a mixture of traditional village farming, modern
agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern industries, and a multitude
of support services. A large share of the population, perhaps as much as 40%,
remains too poor to afford an adequate diet. The policy in the 1980s of fueling
economic growth through high government expenditure proved unsustainable,
however, and in the wake of an international payments crisis in 1991 India
has been transforming its semi-socialist, insular economy into a more open,
market-oriented economy. Production, trade, and investment reforms since 1991
have provided new opportunities for Indian businesspersons and an estimated
200 million plus middle class consumers. New Delhi has stimulated exports,
attracted foreign investment, and revived confidence in India's economic prospects.
GDP growth exceeded 6% in 1995 and in 1996. Most of the country's external
fundamentals - including the current account balance and reserves (now about
$19 billion) - are healthy. Even so, the Indian Government needs to restore
the early momentum of reform, especially by continuing reductions in the extensive
remaining government regulations. The government will also have to deal with
rising government expenditures and higher debt servicing which could create
a debt trap by the turn of the century. Even if a series of weak coalition
governments come to power in the next few years and are unable to push reforms
aggressively, parts of the economy that have already benefited from deregulation
will continue to grow. Moreover, the country can build on other strengths,
including its diverse industrial base, large scientific and technical pool,
its well-developed legal system, and its large middle class.
