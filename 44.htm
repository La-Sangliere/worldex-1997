<p>
<b>Economy - overview:</b> Burma has a mixed economy with private activity dominant in agriculture,
light industry, and transport, and with substantial state-controlled activity,
mainly in energy, heavy industry, and the rice trade. Government policy in
the last eight years, 1989-96, has aimed at revitalizing the economy after
three decades of tight central planning. Thus, private activity has markedly
increased; foreign investment has been encouraged, so far with moderate success;
and efforts continue to increase the efficiency of state enterprises. Published
estimates of Burma's foreign trade are greatly understated because of the
volume of black-market trade. A major ongoing problem is the failure to achieve
monetary and fiscal stability. Although Burma remains a poor Asian country,
its rich resources furnish the potential for substantial long-term increases
in income, exports, and living standards.
