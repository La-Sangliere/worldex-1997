<b>Economy - overview:</b> Despite the efforts of South Africa's first majority-run government,
income inequality remains among the world's most extreme. Many of the white
one-seventh of the South African population enjoy incomes, material comforts,
and health and educational standards equal to those of Western Europe. In
contrast, most of the remaining population suffers from the poverty patterns
of the Third World, including unemployment, lack of job skills, and bleak
living conditions. The main strength of the economy lies in its rich mineral
resources, which provide two-thirds of exports. Economic developments for
the remainder of the 1990s will be driven largely by the new government's
attempts to improve black living standards, to set the country on a steady
export-led growth path, and to cut back the enormous numbers of unemployed.
The economy in recent years has absorbed less than 5% of the more than 300,000
workers entering the labor force annually. Local economists estimate that
the economy must grow at least 5% in real terms annually to absorb all of
the new entrants, much less reduce the accumulated total.
