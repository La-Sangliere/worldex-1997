<b>Economy - overview:</b> Economic activity is strongly linked to the US, with which American
Samoa conducts the great bulk of its foreign trade. Tuna fishing and tuna
processing plants are the backbone of the private sector, with canned tuna
the primary export. The tuna canneries and the government are by far the two
largest employers. Other economic activities include a slowly developing tourist
industry. Transfers from the US Government add substantially to American Samoa's
economic well-being. According to one observer, attempts by the government
to develop a larger and broader economy are restrained by Samoa's remote location,
its limited transportation, and its devastating hurricanes.
