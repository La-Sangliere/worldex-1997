<p>
<b>Economy - overview:</b> Iran's economy is a mixture of central planning, state ownership of
oil and other large enterprises, village agriculture, and small-scale private
 trading and service ventures. Under President RAFSANJANI, the government
adopted a number of market reforms to reduce the state's role in the economy,
but most of these changes have moved slowly or have been reversed because
of political opposition. In the early 1990s, Iran experienced a financial
crisis caused by an import surge that began in 1989 and general financial
mismanagement. In 1993-1994, Iran rescheduled $15 billion in debt, with the
bulk of payments due in 1996-97. The strong oil market in 1996 has helped
ease financial pressures, however, and Tehran has so far made timely debt
service payments. In 1996, Iran's oil earnings - which account for 85% of
total export revenues - climbed 20% from the previous year. Iran's financial
situation will remain tight through the end of the decade, and continued timely
debt service payments will depend, in part, on persistent strong oil prices
during the next few years.
