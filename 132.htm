risks for humans and animals; industrial pollution is severe in some cities;
because the two main rivers which flowed into the Aral Sea have been diverted
for irrigation, it is drying up and leaving behind a harmful layer of chemical
pesticides and natural salts; these substances are then picked up by the wind
and blown into noxious dust storms; pollution in the Caspian Sea; soil pollution
from overuse of agricultural chemicals and salinization from faulty irrigation
practices

<b>Economy - overview:</b> Kazakstan, the second largest of the former Soviet states in territory,
possesses enormous untapped fossil fuel reserves as well as plentiful supplies
of other minerals and metals. It also has considerable agricultural potential
with its vast steppe lands accommodating both livestock and grain production.
Kazakstan's industrial sector rests on the extraction and processing of these
natural resources and also on a relatively large machine building sector specializing
in construction equipment, tractors, agricultural machinery, and some defense
items. The breakup of the USSR and the collapse of demand for Kazakstan's
traditional heavy industry products have resulted in a sharp contraction of
the economy since 1991, with the steepest annual decline occurring in 1994.
In 1995-96 the pace of the government program of economic reform and privatization
quickened, resulting in a substantial shifting of assets into the private
sector. The December 1996 signing of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium agreement
to build a new pipeline from Kazakstan's western Tengiz oil field to the Black
Sea increases prospects for substantially larger oil exports in several years.
The emigration of large numbers of skilled Slavic managers and technicians
from the northern industrial areas will hold back future growth.
