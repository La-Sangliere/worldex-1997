<b>Economy - overview:</b> Despite sustained domestic and international efforts to improve economic
and demographic prospects, Bangladesh remains one of the world's poorest,
most densely populated, and least developed nations. Annual GDP growth has
averaged over 4% in recent years from a low base. Its economy is largely agricultural,
with the cultivation of rice the single most important activity in the economy.
Major impediments to growth include frequent cyclones and floods, the inefficiency
of state-owned enterprises, a rapidly growing labor force that cannot be absorbed
by agriculture, delays in exploiting energy resources (natural gas), inadequate
power supplies, and slow implementation of economic reforms. Frequent strikes
that crippled the economy in 1995 and early 1996 subsided after Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina WAJED's Awami League government assumed power in mid-1996, allowing
a return to normal economic activity. The current government has made some
headway improving the climate for foreign investors and liberalizing the capital
markets; for example, it has negotiated with foreign firms for oil and gas
exploration, better countrywide distribution of cooking gas, and the construction
of natural gas pipelines and power plants. Progress on other economic reforms
has been halting because of opposition from the bureaucracy, public sector
unions, and other vested interest groups.
