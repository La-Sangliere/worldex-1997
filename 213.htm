<b>Economy - overview:</b> This small poor island economy has become increasingly dependent on
cocoa since independence over 20 years ago. However, cocoa production has
substantially declined because of drought and mismanagement. The resulting
shortage of cocoa for export has created a persistent balance-of-payments
problem. Sao Tome has to import all fuels, most manufactured goods, consumer
goods, and a significant amount of food. Over the years, it has been unable
to service its external debt and has had to depend on concessional aid and
debt rescheduling. Considerable potential exists for development of a tourist
industry, and the government has taken steps to expand facilities in recent
years. The government also has attempted to reduce price controls and subsidies,
but economic growth has remained sluggish.
