<b>Economy - overview:</b> Estonia continues to experience strong economic growth after its economy
bottomed out in 1993. Bolstered by a widespread national desire to reintegrate
into Western Europe, Estonia has adhered to disciplined fiscal and financial
policies and has led the FSU countries in pursuing economic reform. Monthly
inflation has been held to 2% in 1995-96. Following four years of decline,
Estonia's GDP grew at 3% in 1995 and 1996. Despite these positive economic
indicators, the current account deficit is widening. The resident IMF representative
in Estonia has been worried since early 1996 about a rising public sector
deficit boosted by local government spending. Small- and medium-scale privatization
is essentially complete, and large-scale privatization is progressing gradually.
In 1996, Estonia's national airline was privatized; in 1997 Estonia plans
to privatize large infrastructure, i.e., Eesti Energia, Tallinn Port, Estonian
Telecom, and Oil Shale. Estonia has successfully reoriented its trade toward
the West, two-thirds of exports now going to Western markets. Estonia's free
trade policies were the cornerstone of its negotiations with the European
Union, and led to the signing of an association agreement in June 1995. Estonia
was the only Baltic state not to have a transition period imposed by the EU
prior to its implementation of a free trade agreement.
