<b>Economy - overview:</b> The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, although the poorest republic
in the former Yugoslav federation, can meet basic food and energy needs through
its own agricultural and coal resources. The economy slowly rebounded in 1996
after years of recession. Continued recovery depends on Macedonia's ability
to redevelop trade ties with Greece and Serbia and Montenegro; as well as
on Skopje's continued commitment to economic liberalization. The economy depends
on outside sources for all of its oil and gas and most of its modern machinery
and parts. An important supplement of GDP is the remittances from thousands
of Macedonians working in Germany and other West European nations.
