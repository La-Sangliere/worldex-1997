<b>Economy - overview:</b> Key sectors in this island economy are bauxite (alumina and bauxite
account for more than half of exports) and tourism. Since assuming office
in 1992, Prime Minister PATTERSON has consolidated the market-oriented reforms
 initiated by his predecessor, Michael MANLEY, to make Jamaica a regional
leader in economic reform. PATTERSON has eliminated most price controls, streamlined
tax schedules, and privatized government enterprises. Tight monetary and fiscal
policies under an IMF program have helped slow inflation and stabilize the
exchange rate, but, as a result, economic growth has slowed down and unemployment
remains high. Jamaica's medium-term prospects depend largely on its ability
to continue to attract foreign capital and to limit speculation against the
Jamaican dollar.
