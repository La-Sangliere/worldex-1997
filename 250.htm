<b>Economy - overview:</b> After Russia, the Ukrainian republic was far and away the most important
economic component of the former Soviet Union, producing about four times
the output of the next-ranking republic. Its fertile black soil generated
more than one-fourth of Soviet agricultural output, and its farms provided
substantial quantities of meat, milk, grain, and vegetables to other republics.
Likewise, its diversified heavy industry supplied equipment and raw materials
to industrial and mining sites in other regions of the former USSR. Shortly
after the implosion of the USSR in December 1991, the Ukrainian Government
liberalized most prices and erected a legal framework for privatization, but
widespread resistance to reform within the government and the legislature
soon stalled reform efforts and led to some backtracking. Output in 1992-96
fell precipitously to less than half the 1991 level. Loose monetary policies
pushed inflation to hyperinflationary levels in late 1993. Since his election
in July 1994, President KUCHMA has pushed a comprehensive economic reform
program, maintained financial discipline, and tried to remove almost all remaining
controls over prices and foreign trade. Implementation of KUCHMA's economic
agenda is encountering considerable resistance from parliament, entrenched
bureaucrats, and industrial interests. However, if KUCHMA succeeds in implementing
aggressive market reforms during 1997, the economy should reverse its downward
trend, with real growth occurring by late 1997 and into 1998.
