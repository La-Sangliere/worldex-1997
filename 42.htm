<b>Economy - overview:</b> One of the poorest countries of central Europe, Bulgaria has slowly
continued the process of moving from its old command economy towards a market-oriented
economy. Slow advancement on economic reforms pitched the economy into crisis
in 1996, marked by a banking system in turmoil, a depreciating currency, inflation
of 311% and contracting production and foreign trade. Foreign exchange reserves
dwindled to extremely low levels ($518 million), while dramatically hiked
interest rates added to the domestic debt burden and stifled growth. GDP fell
by 10% in 1996, after experiencing 2.6% growth in 1995. Privatization of state-owned
industries stagnated, although the first auction of a mass privatization program
was undertaken in late 1996. Lagging progress on structural reforms led to
postponement of IMF disbursements under a $580 million standby loan agreed
to in July. In November 1996, the IMF proposed a currency board as Bulgaria's
best chance to restore confidence in the lev, eliminate discretionary spending,
and avoid hyperinflation. The government has pledged to sell some of the country's
most attractive state assets to the highest foreign bidders in 1997. The Bulgarian
economy is projected to have another year of negative growth (minus 5%), and
inflation near 700% in 1997, assuming introduction of a currency board in
July of 1997.
