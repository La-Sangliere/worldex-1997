<b>Economy - overview:</b> Because of its offshore oil resources and favorable agricultural conditions,
Cameroon has one of the best-endowed primary commodity economies in sub-Saharan
Africa. Still, it faces many of the serious problems facing other underdeveloped
countries, such as political instability, a top-heavy civil service, and a
generally unfavorable climate for business enterprise. The development of
the oil sector led to rapid economic growth between 1970 and 1985. Growth
came to an abrupt halt in 1986, precipitated by steep declines in the prices
of major exports: coffee, cocoa, and petroleum. Export earnings were cut by
almost one-third, and inefficiencies in fiscal management were exposed. Since
1990, the government has embarked on various IMF and World Bank programs designed
to spur business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, improve trade
and recapitalize the nation's banks. Political instability, following suspect
elections in 1992, has limited the effectiveness of aid programs. Currently,
Cameroon receives only minimal assistance from the IMF and the World Bank.
Although the 50% devaluation of the currency of 12 January 1994  improved
the potential for export growth, mismanagement remains and is the main barrier
to economic improvement. The devaluation led to a spurt in inflation to 48%
in 1994, but it moderated in 1995-96. Progress toward privatization of remaining
state industry remains slow.
