<b>Economy - overview:</b> Since World War II, the Italian economy has changed from one based on
agriculture into a ranking industrial economy, with approximately the same
total and per capita output as France and the UK. This basically capitalistic
economy is still divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private
companies, and a less developed agricultural south, with large public enterprises.
Most raw materials needed by industry and over 75% of energy requirements
must be imported. In the second half of 1992, Rome became unsettled by the
prospect of not qualifying to participate in EU plans for economic and monetary
union later in the decade; thus, it finally began to address its huge fiscal
imbalances. Subsequently, the government has adopted fairly stringent budgets,
abandoned its inflationary wage indexation system, and started to scale back
its generous social welfare programs, including pension and health care benefits.
In November 1996 the lire rejoined the European monetary system, which it
had left in September 1992 when under extreme pressure in currency markets.
Italy in early 1997 faces the problem of restructuring its economy to meet
Maastricht criteria for inclusion in the EMU, together with other problems
of refurbishing a tottering communications system, curbing industrial pollution,
and adjusting to new EU and global competitive forces.
