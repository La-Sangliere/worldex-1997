<b>Current issues:</b> The Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government
Arrangements ("the DOP"), signed in Washington on 13 September 1993, provides
for a transitional period not exceeding five years of Palestinian interim
self-government in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Permanent status negotiations
began on 5 May 1996. Under the DOP, Israel agreed to transfer certain powers
and responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority, which includes a Palestinian
Legislative Council elected in January 1996, as part of interim self-governing
arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A transfer of powers and responsibilities
for the Gaza Strip and Jericho has taken place pursuant to the Israel-PLO
4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area and in additional
areas of the West Bank pursuant to the Israel-PLO 28 September 1995 Interim
 Agreement. The DOP provides that Israel will retain responsibility during
the transitional period for external security and for internal security and
public order of settlements and Israelis. Permanent status is to be determined
through direct negotiations which began on 5 May 1996.

<b>Economy - overview:</b> Economic progress in the Gaza Strip has been hampered by tight Israeli
security restrictions. In 1991 roughly 40% of Gaza Strip workers were employed
across the border by Israeli industrial, construction, and agricultural enterprises,
with worker remittances supplementing GDP by roughly 50%. Gaza has depended
upon Israel for nearly 90% of its external trade. The Persian Gulf crisis
and its aftershocks has dealt blows to Gaza since August 1990. Worker remittances
from the Gulf states have dropped, unemployment and popular unrest have increased,
and living standards have fallen. The withdrawal of Israel from the Gaza Strip
in May 1994 has added to the set of adjustment problems. This series of disruptions
has meant a sharp decline in employment in Israel since 1991 and a drop in
GDP as a whole. An estimated 378,000 persons were in refugee camps in 1996.
