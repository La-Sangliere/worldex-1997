<b>Economy - overview:</b> More than 90% of this command economy is socialized; agricultural land
is collectivized; and state-owned industry produces 95% of manufactured goods.
State control of economic affairs is unusually tight even for a communist
country because of the small size and homogeneity of the society and the strict
rule of KIM Il-song in the past and now his son, KIM Chong-il. Economic growth
during the period 1984-88 averaged 2%-3%, but output declined by an average
of 4%-5% annually during 1989-96 because of systemic problems and disruptions
in socialist-style economic relations and technological links with the former
USSR and China. The leadership has insisted on maintaining its high level
of military outlays from a shrinking economic pie. Moreover, a serious drawdown
in inventories and critical shortages in the energy sector have led to increasing
interruptions in industrial production. Abundant mineral resources and hydropower
have formed the basis of industrial development since World War II. Manufacturing
is centered on heavy industry, including military industry, with light industry
lagging far behind. Despite the use of improved seed varieties, expansion
of irrigation, and the heavy use of fertilizers, North Korea has not yet become
self-sufficient in food production. Indeed, a shortage of arable lands, several
years of poor harvests, systemic inefficiencies, a cumbersome distribution
system, and extensive floods in 1995-96 have resulted in recurring food shortages.
Substantial grain shipments from Japan and South Korea are offsetting a portion
of the losses. North Korea remains far behind South Korea in economic development
and living standards.
