<b>Economy - overview:</b> Jordan is a small Arab country with inadequate supplies of water and
other natural resources such as oil and coal. Jordan benefited from increased
 Arab aid during the oil boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s, when its
annual real GNP growth averaged more than 10%. In the remainder of the 1980s,
however, reductions in both Arab aid and worker remittances slowed real economic
growth to an average of roughly 2% per year. Imports - mainly oil, capital
goods, consumer durables, and food - outstripped exports, with the difference
covered by aid, remittances, and borrowing. In mid-1989, the Jordanian Government
began debt-rescheduling negotiations and agreed to implement an IMF-supported
program designed to gradually reduce the budget deficit and implement badly
needed structural reforms. The Persian Gulf crisis that began in August 1990,
however, aggravated Jordan's already serious economic problems, forcing the
government to shelve the IMF program, stop most debt payments, and suspend
rescheduling negotiations. Aid from Gulf Arab states, worker remittances,
and trade contracted; and refugees flooded the country, producing serious
balance-of-payments problems, stunting GDP growth, and straining government
resources. The economy rebounded in 1992, largely due to the influx of capital
repatriated by workers returning from the Gulf, but the recovery was uneven
in 1994-96. The government is implementing the reform program adopted in 1992
and continues to secure rescheduling and write-offs of its heavy foreign debt.
 Debt, poverty, and unemployment remain Jordan's biggest on-going problems.
