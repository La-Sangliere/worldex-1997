<b>Coastline:</b> 0 km 
<br><i>note :</i> Uzbekistan borders the Aral Sea (420 km)

<p>
<b>Climate:</b> mostly midlatitude desert, long, hot summers, mild winters; semiarid
grassland in east 

<p>
<b>Terrain:</b> mostly flat-to-rolling sandy desert with dunes; broad, flat intensely
irrigated river valleys along course of Amu Darya and Syr Darya; Fergana Valley
in east surrounded by mountainous Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan; shrinking Aral

chemical pesticides and natural salts; these substances are then blown from
the increasingly exposed lake bed and contribute to desertification; water
pollution from industrial wastes and the heavy use of fertilizers and pesticides
is the cause of many human health disorders; increasing soil salinization;
soil contamination from agricultural chemicals, including DDT

<b>Economy - overview:</b> Uzbekistan is a dry, landlocked country of which 10% consists of intensely
cultivated, irrigated river valleys. It was one of the poorest areas of the
former Soviet Union with more than 60% of its population living in overpopulated
rural communities. Uzbekistan is now the world's third largest cotton exporter,
a major producer of gold and natural gas, and a regionally significant producer
of chemicals and machinery. Following independence in December 1991, the government
sought to prop up its Soviet-style command economy with subsidies and tight
controls on production and prices. Faced with high rates of inflation, however,
the government stepped up the pace of reform in mid-1994, by introducing 
tighter monetary policies, expanding privatization, slightly reducing the
role of the state in the economy, and improving the environment for foreign
investors. Nevertheless, the state continues to be a dominating influence
in the economy, and reforms have so far failed to bring about much-needed
structural changes. The IMF suspended Uzbekistan's $185 million standby arrangement
in late 1996 because of governmental steps that made impossible fulfillment
of Fund conditions.
