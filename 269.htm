<p>
<b>Economy - overview:</b> Taiwan has a dynamic capitalist economy with considerable guidance of
investment and foreign trade by government officials and partial government
ownership of some large banks and industrial firms. Real growth in GDP has
averaged about 9% a year during the past three decades. Export growth has
been even faster and has provided the impetus for industrialization. Inflation
and unemployment are low. Agriculture contributes less than 4% to GDP, down
from 35% in 1952. Traditional labor-intensive industries are steadily being
moved off-shore and replaced with more capital- and technology-intensive industries.
Taiwan has become a major investor in China, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines,
Malaysia, and Vietnam. The tightening of labor markets has led to an influx
of foreign workers, both legal and illegal.
