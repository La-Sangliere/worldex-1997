increased environmental concern by postcommunist governments; air pollution
nonetheless remains serious because of sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-fired
power plants, and the resulting acid rain has caused forest damage; water
pollution from industrial and municipal sources is also a problem, as is disposal
of hazardous wastes

<b>Economy - overview:</b> In 1996, Poland continued to make good progress in the difficult transition
to a market economy. The transition began on 1 January 1990, when the new
democratic government instituted shock therapy by decontrolling prices, slashing
subsidies, and drastically reducing import barriers. Although real GDP fell
sharply in 1990 and 1991, in 1992 Poland became the first country in the region
to resume economic growth with a 2.6% increase. Growth advanced to 3.8% in
1993, 5.2% in 1994, 6.5% in 1995, and 6.0% in 1996. Most of the growth since
1991 has come from the booming private sector, which now accounts for more
than 60% of GDP, attributable mostly to the creation of new private firms.
Large-scale industry still remains largely in state hands. The trade and current
account balances officially are in deficit but in fact both have comfortable
surpluses because of large, unrecorded sales to cross-border visitors. The
government has promised to extend privatization and social welfare reform
and to maintain fiscal and monetary discipline. As for external debt, the
burden was sharply reduced by reschedulings and write-offs of both private
and official debt during 1991-95.
