<b>Economy - overview:</b> The UK is one of the world's great trading powers and financial centers,
and its essentially capitalistic economy ranks among the four largest in Western
Europe. Over the past 17 years the ruling Tories have greatly reduced public
ownership and contained the growth of social welfare programs. Agriculture
is intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by European standards, producing
about 60% of food needs with only about 1% of the labor force. The UK has
large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves; primary energy production accounts
for 12% of GDP, one of the highest shares of any industrial nation. Services,
particularly banking, insurance, and business services, account by far for
the largest proportion of GDP while industry continues to decline in importance,
now employing only 25% of the work force. The economy registered 3.9% GDP
growth in 1994, the best rate for six years, but slipped back to 2.7% in 1995
and 2.4% in 1996. Exports and manufacturing output have been the primary engines
of growth. Unemployment is gradually falling. Inflation is a comfortable 2.6%.
A major economic policy question for the UK in the late 1990s is the terms
on which it participates in the financial and economic integration of Europe.
