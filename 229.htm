<b>Economy - overview:</b> Sudan is buffeted by civil war, chronic political instability, adverse
weather, high inflation, a drop in remittances from abroad, and counterproductive
economic policies. The private sector's main areas of activity are agriculture
and trading, with most private industrial investment predating 1980. Agriculture
employs 80% of the work force. Industry mainly processes agricultural items.
Sluggish economic performance over the past decade, attributable largely to
declining annual rainfall, has kept per capita income at low levels. A large
foreign debt and huge arrearages continue to cause difficulties. In 1990 the
International Monetary Fund took the unusual step of declaring Sudan noncooperative
because of its nonpayment of arrearages to the Fund. After Sudan backtracked
on promised reforms in 1992-93, the IMF threatened to expel Sudan from the
Fund. To avoid expulsion, Khartoum agreed to make payments on its arrears
to the Fund, liberalize exchange rates, and reduce subsidies, measures it
has partially implemented. The government's continued prosecution of the civil
war and its growing international isolation continued to inhibit growth in
the nonagricultural sectors of the economy during 1996. Hyperinflation has
raised consumer prices above the reach of most. Popular unrest erupted several
times in 1996 in reaction to unpopular government economic decisions.
