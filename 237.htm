<b>Economy - overview:</b> Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world. The economy is
heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for 57% of GDP, provides
85% of exports, and employs 90% of the work force. Topography and climatic
 conditions, however, limit cultivated crops to only 4% of the land area.
Industry accounts for 17% of GDP and is mainly limited to processing agricultural
products and light consumer goods. The economic recovery program announced
in mid-1986 has generated notable increases in agricultural production and
financial support for the program by bilateral donors. The World Bank, the
International Monetary Fund, and bilateral donors have provided funds to rehabilitate
Tanzania's deteriorated economic infrastructure. Growth in 1991-96 has featured
a pickup in industrial production and a substantial increase in output of
minerals, led by gold. Recent banking reforms have helped increase private
sector growth and investment.
