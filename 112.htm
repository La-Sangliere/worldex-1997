<p>
<b>Economy - overview:</b> Hong Kong has a bustling free market economy with few tariffs or nontariff
barriers. Natural resources are limited, and food and raw materials must be
imported. Manufacturing and construction account for about 18% of GDP. Goods
and services exports account for about 50% of GDP. Real GDP growth averaged
a remarkable 8% in 1987-88, slowed to 3.0% in 1989-90, and picked up to 4.2%
in 1991, 5.0% in 1992, 5.2% in 1993, 5.5% in 1994, 4.8% in 1995, and 4.7%
in 1996. A shortage of labor continues to put upward pressure on prices and
the cost of living. Prospects for 1997 remain bright so long as major trading
partners continue to be reasonably prosperous and so long as investors feel
China will support free market practices after the takeover on 1 July 1997.
