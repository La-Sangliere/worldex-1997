<b>Historical perspective:</b> After enduring decades of civil warfare among ethnic groups as well
as invasions by Libya, Chad got started toward a more stable state with the
seizure of the government in early December 1990 by former northern guerrilla
leader Idress DEBY. His transitional government eventually suppressed armed
rebellion in all quarters of the country, settled the territorial dispute
with Libya on terms favorable to Chad, produced a democratic constitution
which was ratified by popular referendum in March 1996, held multiparty national
presidential elections in June and July 1996 (DEBY won with 67% of the vote),
and held multiparty elections to the National Assembly in January and February
1997, in which Idress DEBY's party, Patriotic Salvation Movement or MPS, won
a majority of the seats.

<b>Economy - overview:</b> Unfavorable climate, geographic remoteness, poor resource endowment,
and lack of infrastructure make Chad one of the most underdeveloped countries
in the world. Its economy is hobbled by political turmoil, drought, and food
shortages. Consequently the economy has shown little progress in recent years
in overcoming a severe setback brought on by civil war in the late 1980s.
About 85% of the work force is involved in subsistence farming and fishing.
Cotton is the major cash crop, accounting for at least half of exports. Chad
is highly dependent on foreign aid, especially food credits, given chronic
food shortages in several regions. Of all the Francophone countries in Africa,
Chad has benefited the least from the 50% devaluation of their currencies
on 12 January 1994. Despite an increase in external financial aid and price
increases for cotton - the primary source of foreign exchange - the corrupt
and enfeebled government bureaucracy continues to postpone payment of public
sector salaries and to dampen economic enterprise by neglecting payments to
domestic suppliers. The devaluation resulted in stepped-up inflation of 41%
in 1994; inflation fell to 9% in 1995 but it remains high compared with other
Francophone countries. In one favorable development, Chad in December 1996
concluded an agreement with ESSO/Chad (EXXON) for drilling and extracting
petroleum at Doba. Oil will be piped through Cameroon for export.
