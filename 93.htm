<b>Current issues:</b> Beset by ethnic and civil strife since independence in 1991, Georgia
began to stabilize in 1994. Separatist conflicts in Abkhazia and South Ossetia
have been dormant since spring 1994, although political settlements remain
elusive. Russian peacekeepers are deployed in both regions and a UN Observer
Mission is operating in Abkhazia. As a result of these conflicts, Georgia
still has about 250,000 internally displaced people. In 1995, Georgia adopted
a new constitution and conducted generally free and fair nationwide presidential
and parliamentary elections. In 1996, the government focused its attention
to implementing an ambitious economic reform program and professionalizing
its parliament. Violence and organized crime were sharply curtailed in 1995
and 1996, but corruption remains rife.

<b>Economy - overview:</b> Georgia's economy has traditionally revolved around Black Sea tourism;
cultivation of citrus fruits, tea, and grapes; mining of manganese and copper;
and output of a small industrial sector producing wine, metals, machinery,
chemicals, and textiles. The country imports the bulk of its energy needs,
including natural gas and oil products. Its only sizable internal energy resource
is hydropower. Despite the severe damage the economy has suffered due to civil
strife, Georgia, with the help of the IMF and World Bank, has made substantial
economic gains in 1995-96, pushing GDP growth and slashing inflation. Georgia
had been suffering from acute energy shortages, although energy deliveries
improved in 1996. Georgia is pinning its hopes for long-term recovery on the
development of an international transportation corridor through the key Black
Sea ports of P'ot'i and Bat'umi. The decision in 1996 to construct an early
Caspian oil pipeline through Georgia underscores the viability of such a corridor
and may spur greater western investment in the economy. A growing trade deficit
and political uncertainties cloud the short-term economic picture.
