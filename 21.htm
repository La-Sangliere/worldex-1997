<b>Current issues:</b> Azerbaijan continues to be plagued by an unresolved nine-year-old conflict
with Armenian separatists over its Nagorno-Karabakh region. The Karabakh Armenians
have declared independence and seized almost 20% of the country's territory,
creating almost 1 million Azerbaijani refugees in the process. Both sides
have generally observed a Russian-mediated cease-fire in place since May 1994,
and support the OSCE-mediated peace process, now entering its fifth year.
Nevertheless, Baku and Xankandi (Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh region) remain
far apart on most substantive issues from the placement and composition of
a peacekeeping force to the enclave's ultimate political status, and prospects
for a negotiated settlement remain dim.

<b>Area:</b> 
<br><i>total:</i> 86,600 sq km 
<br><i>land:</i> 86,100 sq km 
<br><i>water:</i> 500 sq km 
<br><i>note:</i> includes the exclave of Naxcivan Autonomous Republic and the Nagorno-Karabakh
region; the region's autonomy was abolished by Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet
on 26 November 1991

<p>
<b>Area - comparative:</b> slightly smaller than Maine

<p>
<b>Land boundaries:</b>

<b>Climate:</b> dry, semiarid steppe

<p>
<b>Terrain:</b> large, flat Kur-Araz Lowland (much of it below sea level) with Great
Caucasus Mountains to the north, Qarabag (Karabakh) Upland in west; Baku 
lies on Abseron (Apsheron) Peninsula that juts into Caspian Sea

<b>Environment - current issues:</b> local scientists consider the Abseron (Apsheron) Peninsula (including
Baku and Sumqayit) and the Caspian Sea to be the ecologically most devastated
 area in the world because of severe air, water, and soil pollution; soil
pollution results from the use of DDT as a pesticide and also from toxic defoliants
used in the production of cotton

<b>Economy - overview:</b> Azerbaijan is less developed industrially than either Armenia or Georgia,
the other Transcaucasian states. It resembles the Central Asian states in
its majority nominally Muslim population, high structural unemployment, and
low standard of living. The economy's most prominent products are oil, cotton,
and gas. Production from the Caspian oil and gas field has been in decline
for several years, but the November 1994 ratification of the $7.5 billion
oil deal with a consortium of Western companies should generate the funds
needed to spur future industrial development. Azerbaijan shares all the formidable
problems of the ex-Soviet republics in making the transition from a command
to a market economy, but its considerable energy resources brighten its long-term
prospects. Baku has only recently begun making progress on economic reform,
and old economic ties and structures are slowly being replaced. A major short-term
obstacle to economic progress, including stepped up foreign investment, is
the continuing conflict with Armenia over the ethnic Armenian-dominated region
of Nagorno-Karabakh. Trade with Russia and the other former Soviet republics
is declining in importance while trade is building up with the nations of
Europe, Turkey, Iran and the UAE.
