<p>
<b>Economy - overview:</b> The economy is based on family and corporate agriculture, which accounts
for 25% of GDP, employs about 60% of the labor force, and supplies two-thirds
of exports. Manufacturing and construction, predominantly in private hands,
account for about 20% of GDP and 18% of the labor force. In both 1990 and
1991, the economy grew by 3%, the fourth and fifth consecutive years of mild
growth. In 1992 growth picked up to almost 5% as government policies favoring
competition and foreign trade and investment took stronger hold. In 1993-94,
despite political unrest, this momentum continued, foreign investment held
up, and annual growth averaged 4%. Strong international prices for Guatemala's
traditional commodity exports featured 4.9% growth in 1995; growth receded
to 3% in 1996. Given the markedly uneven distribution of land and income,
the government faces major obstacles in its program of economic modernization
and the reduction of poverty.
