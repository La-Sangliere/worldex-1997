<b>Current issues:</b> Armenia's leaders remain preoccupied by Armenia's nine-year old conflict
with Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave. Although a cease-fire has
been in effect since May 1994, the sides have not made substantial progress
toward a peaceful resolution. President TER-PETROSSIAN's latitude on the issue
may be further constrained by his controversial reelection in September 1996.
When supporters of the main opposition candidate stormed the parliament following
the announcement of TER-PETROSSIAN's victory, MVD forces were called in to
restore order. The subsequent political standoff between government and opposition
supporters diminished in late 1996 as the government has gradually attempted
reconciliation. Despite these political problems, the Armenian government
has been pursuing its aggressive economic reform program, although implementation
of its privatization program stalled in late 1996.

<b>Economy - overview:</b> Under the old Soviet central planning system, Armenia had developed
a modern industrial sector, supplying machine building tools, textiles, and
other manufactured goods to sister republics in exchange for raw materials
and energy. Since the implosion of the USSR in December 1991, Armenia has
 switched to small-scale agriculture away from the large agroindustrial complexes
of the Soviet area. The privatization of industry has been at a much slower
pace. Armenia is a food importer and its mineral deposits (gold, bauxite)
are small. The ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the ethnic Armenian-dominated
region of Nagorno-Karabakh and the embargoes imposed by Azerbaijan and Turkey
contributed to a severe economic decline in the early 1990s. By 1994, however,
the Armenian Government had launched an ambitious IMF-sponsored economic program
that has resulted in positive growth rates in 1995 and 1996. Armenia also
managed to slash inflation and to privatize most small and medium-sized enterprises.
The chronic energy shortages Armenia suffered in recent years has been partially
offset by the energy supplied by one of its nuclear power plants at Metsamor,
which in 1996 supplied about 40% of the country's energy needs, according
to the Armenian Government. Moreover, Armenia is expanding its energy imports
from Iran.
