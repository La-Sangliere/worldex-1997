<b>Economy - overview:</b> Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked country, highly dependent
on farming and livestock raising (sheep and goats). Economic considerations
 have played second fiddle to political and military upheavals during more
than 17 years of war, including the nearly 10-year Soviet military occupation
(which ended 15 February 1989). During the war one-third of the population
fled the country, with Pakistan and Iran sheltering a combined peak of more
than 6 million refugees. Now, only 750,000 registered Afghan refugees remain
in Pakistan and about 1.2 million in Iran. Another 1 million have probably
moved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan. Gross domestic product
has fallen substantially over the past 17 years because of the loss of labor
and capital and the disruption of trade and transport. Millions of people
continue to suffer from insufficient food, clothing, housing, and medical
care. Inflation remains a serious problem throughout the country, with one
estimate putting the rate at 240% in Kabul in 1996. Numerical data are likely
to be either unavailable or unreliable.
