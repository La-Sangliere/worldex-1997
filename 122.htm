<b>Current issues:</b> The territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 war are not included
in the data below, unless otherwise noted. In keeping with the framework 
established at the Madrid Conference in October 1991, bilateral negotiations
are being conducted between Israel and Palestinian representatives, and Israel
and Syria, to achieve a permanent settlement between them. On 25 April 1982,
Israel withdrew from the Sinai pursuant to the 1979 Israel-Egypt Peace treaty.
Outstanding territorial and other disputes with Jordan were resolved in the
26 October 1994 Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace.

under the new law, each voter casts two ballots - one for the direct election
of the prime minister and one for the party in the Knesset; the candidate
that receives the largest percentage of the popular vote then works to form
a coalition with other parties to achieve a parliamentary majority of 61 seats;
finally, the candidate must submit his or her cabinet to the Knesset for approval
and this must be done within 45 days of the election; in contrast to the old
system, under the new law, the prime minister's party need not be the single-largest
party in the Knesset

<b>Economy - overview:</b> Israel has a market economy with substantial government participation.
It depends on imports of crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military equipment.
Despite limited natural resources, Israel has intensively developed its agricultural
and industrial sectors over the past 20 years. Manufacturing and construction
employ about 29% of Israeli workers, agriculture, forestry, and fishing 3.5%,
and services the rest. Israel is largely self-sufficient in food production
except for grains. Diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural products
(fruits and vegetables) are leading exports. Israel usually posts sizable
current account deficits, which are covered by large transfer payments from
abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half of the government's external debt
is owed to the US, which is its major source of economic and military aid.
To earn needed foreign exchange, Israel has been targeting high-technology
niches in international markets, such as medical scanning equipment. The influx
of Jewish immigrants from the former USSR, which topped 750,000 during the
period 1989-96, initially increased unemployment, intensified housing problems,
and strained the government budget. At the same time, the immigrants bring
to the economy valuable scientific and professional expertise.
