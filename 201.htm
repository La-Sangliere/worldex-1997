<p>
<b>Economy - overview:</b> Puerto Rico has one of the most dynamic economies in the Caribbean region.
A diverse industrial sector has surpassed agriculture as the primary locus
 of economic activity and income. Encouraged by duty-free access to the US
and by tax incentives, US firms have invested heavily in Puerto Rico since
the 1950s. US minimum wage laws apply. Sugar production has lost out to dairy
production and other livestock products as the main source of income in the
agricultural sector. Tourism has traditionally been an important source of
income for the island, with estimated arrivals of nearly 3.9 million tourists
in 1993.
