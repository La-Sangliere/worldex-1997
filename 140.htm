<b>Economy - overview:</b> The government of Laos - one of the few remaining official communist
states - has been decentralizing control and encouraging private enterprise
since 1986. The results, starting from an extremely low base, have been striking
- growth has averaged 7.5% annually since 1988. Even so, Laos is a landlocked
country with a primitive infrastructure. It has no railroads, a rudimentary
road system, and limited external and internal telecommunications. Electricity
is available in only a few urban areas. Subsistence agriculture accounts for
half of GDP and provides 80% of total employment. The predominant crop is
rice. In non-drought years, Laos is self-sufficient overall in food, but each
year flood, pests, and localized drought cause shortages in various parts
of the country. For the foreseeable future the economy will continue to depend
on aid from the IMF and other international sources; aid from the former USSR/Eastern
Europe has been cut sharply. As in many developing countries, deforestation
and soil erosion will hamper efforts to maintain the high rate of GDP growth.
