<p>
<b>Economy - overview:</b> Portugal's short-term economic fundamentals remain strong: the economy
has grown by more than 2% during the past two years, with similar growth expected
in 1997. The Socialist government's primary economic goal is to place Portugal
in the first group of countries adopting the single European currency, and
it has instituted a disciplined 1997 budget to bolster Lisbon's chances. Portuguese
government forecasts suggest that it is likely to meet partially the Maastricht
monetary convergence criteria by lowering its budget deficit from 4% of GDP
in 1996 to 2.9% in 1997, although the government predicts that government
debt will be cut only to 68% of GDP, overshooting Maastricht's 60% target.
Social programs - a priority for the Socialists - will still grow slightly
faster than GDP in 1997, mandating strict budget discipline in other areas.
As for the long run, Portugal is increasing its infrastructure spending -
much of it in anticipation of hosting the world's International Exposition
in 1998 - while working to modernize its capital plant and increase competitiveness
in hopes of increasing Portugal's GDP, which remains below 65% of the EU's
average GDP per capita.
