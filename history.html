<H3>A Brief History of Basic Intelligence and <I>The World Factbook</I></H3>
<HR>
<P><I>The Intelligence Cycle is the process by which information is acquired,
converted into intelligence, and made available to policymakers. <B>Information</B>
is raw data from any source that may be fragmentary, contradictory, unreliable,
ambiguous, deceptive, or wrong. <B>Intelligence</B> is information that has been
collected, integrated, evaluated, analyzed, and interpreted. <B>Finished intelligence</B>
is the final product of the Intelligence Cycle ready to be delivered to the
policymaker.</I>
<P>There are three types of finished intelligence: basic, current, and
estimative. Basic intelligence is the fundamental and factual reference material
on a country or issue, current intelligence reports on new developments, and
estimative intelligence judges probable outcomes. The three are mutually supporting
because basic intelligence is the foundation on which the other two are based,
current intelligence helps to continually update the knowledge foundation,
and estimative intelligence serves to revise overall interpretations of country
and issue prospects for both basic and current intelligence. <I>The World Factbook,
The President's Daily Brief,</I> and National Intelligence Estimates are examples
of the three types of finished intelligence. 
<P>The United States has carried on foreign intelligence activities since
the days of George Washington, but only since World War II have they been
coordinated on a governmentwide basis. Three programs have highlighted the
development of coordinated basic intelligence since that time: (1) the Joint
Army Navy Intelligence Studies (JANIS), (2) the National Intelligence Survey
(NIS), and (3) <I>The World Factbook.</I>
<P>During World War II intelligence consumers realized that the production
of basic intelligence by different components of the US Government resulted
in a great duplication of effort and conflicting information. The Japanese
attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 brought home to Congressional and executive
branch leaders the need for integrating and coordinating departmental reports
to national policymakers. Detailed general information was needed not only
on such major powers as Germany and Japan, but also on places of little previous
interest. In the Pacific Theater, for example, the Navy and Marines had to
launch amphibious operations against many islands about which information
was unconfirmed or nonexistent. Intelligence authorities resolved that the
United States should never again be caught unprepared. 
<P>In 1943, Gen. George B. Strong (G-2), Adm. H. C. Train (Office of Naval
Intelligence - ONI), and Gen. William J. Donovan (Director of the Office of
Strategic Services - OSS) decided that a joint effort should be initiated.
A steering committee was appointed on 27 April 1943 that recommended the formation
of a Joint Intelligence Study Publishing Board to assemble, edit, coordinate,
and publish the Joint Army Navy Intelligence Studies (JANIS). JANIS was the
first interdepartmental basic intelligence program and fulfilled the needs
of the US Government for an authoritative and coordinated digest of strategic
basic intelligence. Between April 1943 and July 1947, the board published
 34 JANIS studies. JANIS performed well in the war effort, and numerous letters
of commendation were received including a statement from Adm. Forrest Sherman,
Chief of Staff, Pacific Ocean Areas, which said "JANIS has become the indispensable
reference work for the shore-based planners." 
<P>The need for even more comprehensive basic intelligence in the postwar
world was well expressed in 1946 by George S. Pettee, a noted author on national
security, when he wrote in The Future of American Secret Intelligence (Infantry
Journal Press, 1946, page 46) that world leadership in peace requires more
elaborate intelligence than war. "The conduct of peace involves all countries,
all human activities-not just the enemy and his war production."
<P>The Central Intelligence Agency was established on 26 July 1947 and
officially began operating 18 September 1947. Effective 1 October 1947, the
Director of Central Intelligence assumed operational responsibility for JANIS.
On 13 January 1948, the National Security Council issued Intelligence Directive
(NSCID) No. 3, which officially authorized the National Intelligence Survey
(NIS) program as a peacetime replacement for the wartime JANIS program. Before
adequate NIS sections could be produced, it was necessary to develop gazetteers
and maps for an accurate presentation of intelligence by the contributing
agencies. The US Board on Geographic Names (BGN) compiled the names, the Department
of the Interior produced the gazetteers, and CIA produced the maps. 
<P>The Hoover Commission's Clark Committee, set up in 1954 to study the
structure and administration of the CIA, reported to Congress in 1955 that:
"The National Intelligence Survey is an invaluable publication which provides
the essential elements of basic intelligence on all areas of the world. .
. . There will always be a continuing requirement for keeping the Survey up-to-date."
The Factbook was created as an annual summary and update to the encyclopedic
 NIS studies. The first classified Factbook was published in August 1962,
and the first unclassified version was published in June 1971. The NIS program
was terminated except for the Factbook and gazetteers in 1973. The 1975 Factbook
was the first to be made available to the public with sales through the US
Government Printing Office (GPO). The 1996 edition was the first to be printed
by GPO. The year 1997 marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the
Central Intelligence Agency and the 54th year of continuous basic intelligence
support to the US Government by <I>The World Factbook</I> and its two predecessor programs.
