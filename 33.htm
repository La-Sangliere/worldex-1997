<p>
<b>Economy - overview:</b> The economy, one of the world's smallest and least developed, is based
on agriculture and forestry, which provide the main livelihood for 90% of
the population and account for about 40% of GDP. Agriculture consists largely
of subsistence farming and animal husbandry. Rugged mountains dominate the
terrain and make the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult
and expensive. The economy is closely aligned with India's through strong
 trade and monetary links. The industrial sector is small and technologically
backward, with most production of the cottage industry type. Most development
projects, such as road construction, rely on Indian migrant labor. Bhutan's
hydropower potential and its attraction for tourists are key resources; however,
the government limits the number of tourists to 4,000 per year to minimize
foreign influence. The Bhutanese Government has made some progress in expanding
the nation's productive base and improving social welfare, but growth continues
to be constrained by the government's desire to protect the country's environment
and cultural traditions. Growth picked up in 1995 and the country's balance
of payments remained strong with comfortable reserves. The cautious fiscal
stance planned for FY95/96 suggests continued economic stability in 1996.
However, excessive controls and uncertain policies in areas like industrial
licensing, trade, labor, and finance continue to hamper foreign investment.
