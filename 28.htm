<p>
<b>Economy - overview:</b> At the time of independence in late 1991, Belarus was one of the most
developed of the former Soviet states, inheriting a modern - by Soviet standards
- machine building sector and robust agricultural sector. However, the breakup
of the Soviet Union and its traditional trade ties in December 1991, as well
as the government's failure to embrace market reforms, has resulted in a sharp
economic decline. Privatization is virtually nonexistent and the system of
state orders and distribution persists. Although President LUKASHENKO pronounces
his 1995 macro stabilization policies a success - annual inflation dropped
from 2,220% in 1994 to 244% in 1995 - the IMF has criticized his exchange
rate policies and suspended Minsk's $300 million standby program in November
1995. The overvalued ruble has especially hurt Belarusian exporters, most
of which now operate at a loss. In addition, the January 1995 Customs Union
agreement with Russia - which required Minsk to adjust its foreign trade practices
to mirror Moscow's - has resulted in higher import tariffs for Belarusian
consumers; tariffs rose from 5%-20% to 20%-40%. In general, as of the beginning
of 1997, Belarus has badly lagged in moving away from the old centrally planned
policies of the former USSR.
