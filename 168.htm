<b>Economy - overview:</b> The new government has embraced free-market economics, freezing spending,
easing price controls, liberalizing domestic and international trade. Mongolia's
severe climate, scattered population, and wide expanses of unproductive land,
however, have constrained economic development. Economic activity traditionally
has been based on agriculture and the breeding of livestock. In past years
extensive mineral resources had been developed with Soviet support; total
Soviet assistance at its height amounted to 30% of GDP. The mining and processing
of coal, copper, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and gold account for a large part
of industrial production. The dramatic drop in the price of copper which accounts
for half of the country's export earnings, has held back economic growth.
The Mongolian leadership also has been soliciting support from international
financial agencies and foreign investors. The economy, however, has still
not recovered from the loss of Soviet aid. The country continues to suffer
substantial economic hardships, with one-fourth of the population below the
poverty line.
