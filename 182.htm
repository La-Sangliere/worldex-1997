<b>Economy - overview:</b> The oil-rich Nigerian economy continues to be hobbled by political instability,
corruption, and poor macroeconomic management. Nigeria's unpopular military
rulers have failed to make significant progress in diversifying the economy
away from overdependence on the capital intensive oil sector which provides
half of GDP, 95% of foreign exchange earnings, and about 80% of budgetary
revenues. Regime officials also appear divided on how to redress fundamental
economic imbalances that result in troublesome inflation and the discouragement
of investors. The government's resistance to initiating greater transparency
and accountability in managing the country's multibillion dollar oil earnings
continues to limit economic growth and prevent an agreement with the IMF and
bilateral creditors on debt relief. The largely subsistence agricultural sector
has failed to keep up with rapid population growth, and Nigeria, once a large
net exporter of food, now must import food. Agricultural production in 1996
suffered from severe shortages of fertilizer.
