<b>Economy - overview:</b> Before the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the Republic of Croatia, after
Slovenia, was the most prosperous and industrialized area, with a per capita
output perhaps one-third above the Yugoslav average. Croatia faces considerable
economic problems stemming from: the legacy of longtime communist mismanagement
of the economy; damage during the internecine fighting to bridges, factories,
power lines, buildings, and houses; the large refugee population, both Croatian
and Bosnian; and the disruption of economic ties. Western aid and investment,
especially in the tourist and oil industries, would help restore the economy.
The government has been successful in some reform efforts - partially macroeconomic
stabilization policies - and it has normalized relations with its creditors.
Yet it still is struggling with privatization of large state enterprises and
with bank reform. The draft 1997 budget boosts expenditures on the repair
and upgrading of infrastructure. In 1996, the substantial trade deficit was
 partially offset by increased earnings from tourism.
