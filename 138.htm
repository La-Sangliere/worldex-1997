<b>Economy - overview:</b> Kuwait is a small and relatively open economy with proved crude oil
reserves of about 94 billion barrels - 10% of world reserves. Kuwait has rebuilt
its war-ravaged petroleum sector; its crude oil production averaged 2 million
barrels per day in 1996. Petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP, 90% of
export revenues, and 75% of government income. Kuwait lacks water and has
practically no arable land, thus preventing development of agriculture. With
the exception of fish, it depends almost wholly on food imports. About 75%
of potable water must be distilled or imported. Because of its high per capita
income, comparable with Western European incomes, Kuwait provides its citizens
with extensive health, educational, and retirement benefits. The bulk of the
work force is non-Kuwaiti, living at a considerably lower level. Per capita
military expenditures are among the highest in the world. The economy improved
moderately in 1994-96, with the growth in industry and finance. The World
Bank has urged Kuwait to push ahead with privatization, including in the oil
industry, but the government will move slowly on opening the petroleum sector.
