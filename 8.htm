<p>
<b>Economy - overview:</b> Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's tiny, well-to-do economy, accounts
for roughly 80% of GDP. An estimated 10 million tourists visit annually, attracted
by Andorra's duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts. Andorra's
comparative advantage has recently eroded as the economies of neighboring
France and Spain have been opened up, providing broader availability of goods
and lower tariffs. The banking sector, with its "tax haven" status, also contributes
substantially to the economy. Agricultural production is limited by a scarcity
of arable land, and most food has to be imported. The principal livestock
activity is sheep raising. Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars,
and furniture. Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union and is treated
as an EU member for trade in manufactured goods (no tariffs) and as a non-EU
member for agricultural products.
