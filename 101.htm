<b>Economy - overview:</b> The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light industry, and services.
It is also dependent upon France for large subsidies and imports. Tourism
is a key industry, with most tourists from the US. In addition, an increasingly
large number of cruise ships visit the islands. The traditionally important
sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by other crops, such as bananas (which
now supply about 50% of export earnings), eggplant, and flowers. Other vegetables
and root crops are cultivated for local consumption, although Guadeloupe is
still dependent on imported food, which comes mainly from France. Light industry
consists mostly of sugar and rum production. Most manufactured goods and fuel
are imported. Unemployment is especially high among the young.
