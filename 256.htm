<b>Economy - overview:</b> The economy is based primarily on subsistence or small-scale agriculture
which provides a living for 65% of the population. Fishing and tourism are
the other mainstays of the economy, with 43,000 visitors in 1992. Mineral
deposits are negligible; the country has no known petroleum deposits. A small
light industry sector caters to the local market. Tax revenues come mainly
from import duties. Economic development is hindered by dependence on relatively
few commodity exports, vulnerability to natural disasters, and long distances
from main markets and between constituent islands.
