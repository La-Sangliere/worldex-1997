<p>
<b>Economy - overview:</b> This small landlocked economy is based largely on subsistence agriculture,
which occupies more than 60% of the population. Manufacturing features a number
of agroprocessing factories. Mining has declined in importance in recent years;
high-grade iron ore deposits were depleted by 1978, and health concerns have
cut world demand for asbestos. Exports of soft drink concentrate, sugar and
wood pulp are the main earners of hard currency. Surrounded by South Africa,
except for a short border with Mozambique, Swaziland is heavily dependent
on South Africa from which it receives nearly 90% of its imports and to which
it sends more than half of its exports. Remittances from Swazi workers in
South African mines supplement domestically earned income by as much as 20%.
The government is trying to improve the atmosphere for foreign investment.
Overgrazing, soil depletion, and drought persist as problems for the future.
