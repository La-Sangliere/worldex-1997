<b>Economy - overview:</b> Western observers view the Czech Republic as one of the most politically
and economically stable post-Communist states. Its key macroeconomic indicators
are, in the aggregate, the best in the region, and public opinion polls show
strong support for reform. The country emerged from recession in 1994 with
2.6% growth and reached about 5% growth in both 1995 and 1996 while keeping
a balanced budget and reorienting exports to the EU. Inflation and unemployment
of 8.7% and 3.3% respectively in 1996 are among the lowest in the region.
Prague's mass privatization program, including its innovative distribution
of ownership shares to Czech citizens via "coupon vouchers," has made the
most rapid progress in Eastern Europe. About 80% of the economy is in private
hands or is partially privatized. The Czech Republic appears to be the East
European frontrunner in economic integration with the West; for example, in
1996 it began to strengthen its bankruptcy law and to improve the transparency
of stock market operations. It was the first post-Communist member of the
OECD and is expected to be in the next group of new EU members. Its solid
economic performance has led Standard and Poor's to upgrade the country's
sovereign credit rating to "A" and has attracted over $6.7 billion in direct
foreign investment to Czech industry between 1990 and September 1996 - one
quarter from the US. Prague's biggest macroeconomic concerns now are mounting
trade and current account deficits. In addition, the Czech economy still faces
transition problems. The government continues to exert too much direct and
indirect influence on the privatized economy, and the management of privatized
firms sometimes is ineffective. Insufficient regulation and lack of public
information in the capital markets and the banking system, combined with a
shortage of experienced financial analysts, limit the ability to distribute
 new credit efficiently. The judicial system also has trouble speedily processing
bankruptcy cases. Prague has promised to overhaul its bankruptcy law and improve
stock market and bank operations, but it will take years to ensure compliance.
Prague forecasts a balanced budget, 4.5% GDP growth, 3.3% unemployment and
7.5% to 8% inflation for 1997.
