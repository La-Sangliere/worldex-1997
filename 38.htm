<b>Economy - overview:</b> Possessing large and well-developed agricultural, mining, manufacturing,
and service sectors, Brazil's economy outweighs that of all other South American
countries and is expanding its presence in world markets. Prior to the institution
of a stabilization plan - the Plano Real (Real Plan) - in mid-1994, stratospheric
inflation rates had disrupted economic activity and discouraged foreign investment.
Since then, tight monetary policy has brought inflation under control - consumer
prices increased by only 10% in 1996 compared to more than 1,000% in 1994.
At the same time, GDP growth slowed from 5.7% in 1994 to 2.9% in 1996 due
to tighter credit. The steadily appreciating currency has also encouraged
imports, contributing to a growing trade deficit, and depressed export growth.
Brazil's more stable economy allowed it to weather the fallout in 1995 from
the Mexican peso crisis relatively well, and record levels of foreign investment
have since flowed in, helping to swell official foreign exchange reserves
to $60 billion in 1996; stock markets reflected this increased investor confidence,
gaining 53% in dollar terms. President CARDOSO remains committed to further
reducing inflation in 1997 and putting Brazil on track for expanded economic
growth, but he faces several key challenges. Fiscal reforms requiring constitutional
amendments are stalled in the Brazilian legislature; in their absence, the
government is continuing to run deficits and has limited room to relax its
interest and exchange rate policies much if it wants to keep inflation under
control. High interest rates have made servicing domestic debt dramatically
more burdensome for both public and private sector entities, contributing
to federal and state budget problems and a surge in bankruptcies.
