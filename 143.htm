<p>
<b>Economy - overview:</b> Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho has no important natural
resources other than water. Its economy is based on agriculture, light manufacturing,
and remittances from miners employed in South Africa. The number of such mine
workers has declined steadily over the past five years; in 1996 their remittances
added about 33% to GDP compared with the addition of roughly 67% in 1990.
The great majority of households gain their livelihoods from subsistence farming
and migrant labor; a large portion of the adult male work force is employed
in South African mines. Manufacturing depends largely on farm products which
support the milling, canning, leather, and jute industries. Although drought
has decreased agricultural activity over the past few years, completion of
a major hydropower facility will permit the sale of water to South Africa
and will support the economy's continued expansion. The pace of the privatization
of state-owned firms increased toward the end of 1994.
