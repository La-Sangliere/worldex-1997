<b>Economy - overview:</b> Turkey's dynamic economy is a complex mix of modern industry and commerce
along with traditional village agriculture and crafts. The economy has a strong
and rapidly growing private sector, yet the state still plays a major role
in basic industry, banking, transport, and communication. The current economic
situation is marked by strong growth coupled with worsening imbalances. Real
GDP expanded by about 7% in 1996 but inflation rose to 80%, the current account
deficit reached about 3% of GDP, and the public sector fiscal deficit probably
topped 10% of GDP, leading to speculation that the country could be headed
toward a repeat of its 1994 financial crisis. To some extent, Ankara is caught
in a vicious circle because half of all central government revenue in 1996
went to pay interest on the national debt. The government that took office
in July 1996 - an unusual coalition of Prime Minister ERBAKAN's Islamic Welfare
Party and Deputy Prime Minister CILLER's conservative True Path Party - is
trying to solve the fiscal problem by greatly accelerating Turkey's privatization
 program. It has proposed a balanced budget for 1997, although this is widely
regarded as over optimistic because it is based on earning more privatization
revenue in one year than Turkey has earned over the last decade. Ankara is
trying to increase trade with other countries in the region but most of Turkey's
trade is still with OECD countries. Despite the implementation in January
1996 of a customs union with the EU, foreign direct investment in the country
totaled only about half a billion dollars, perhaps because potential investors
were concerned about the prospects for economic stability.
