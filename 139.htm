<b>Economy - overview:</b> Kyrgyzstan is a small, poor, mountainous country with a predominantly
agricultural economy. Cotton, wool, and meat are the main agricultural products
and exports. Industrial exports included gold, mercury, uranium, and hydropower.
Kyrgyzstan has been one of the most progressive countries of the former Soviet
Union in carrying out market reforms. Following a successful stabilization
program, which lowered inflation from 88% in 1994 to 32% for 1996, attention
is turning toward stimulating growth. Much of the government's stock in enterprises
has been sold. Drops in production have been severe since the break up of
the Soviet Union in December 1991, but by mid-1995 production began to recover
and exports began to increase. Pensioners, unemployed workers, and government
workers with salaries arrears continue to suffer. Foreign assistance plays
a substantial role in the country's budget. In 1996 the economy showed strong
signs that recovery was underway.
