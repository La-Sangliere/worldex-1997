<b>Current issues:</b> Civil war has been the norm since independence from Portugal on 11 November
1975. A cease-fire lasted from 31 May 1991 until October 1992 when the insurgent
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) refused to accept
its defeat in internationally monitored elections and fighting resumed throughout
much of the countryside. The two sides signed another peace accord on 20 November
1994 and the cease-fire is generally holding, but military tensions persist
and banditry is increasing. In order to bring armed insurgents under government
control the peace accord of 20 November 1994 provided for the integration
of former UNITA insurgents into the Angolan armed forces. Military integration
began in June 1996 and a Government of National Unity and Reconciliation was
installed in April 1997. Efforts which began in May 1997 to extend government
into UNITA-occupied areas are proceeding slowly. The original 7,200-man UN
peacekeeping force began a phased drawdown in late 1996. All UN peacekeepers
are scheduled to depart by September 1997 but a small UN military observer
force will probably remain in Angola through 1998.

<b>Economy - overview:</b> Angola is an economy in disarray. Despite its abundant natural resources,
output per capita is among the world's lowest. Subsistence agriculture provides
the main livelihood for 80%-90% of the population but accounts for about 12%
of GDP. Oil production and the supporting activities are vital to the economy,
contributing about 50% to GDP. Notwithstanding the signing of a peace accord
in November 1994, sporadic violence continues, millions of land mines remain,
and many farmers are reluctant to return to their fields. As a result, much
of the country's food must still be imported. To take advantage of its rich
resources - notably gold, diamonds, extensive forests, Atlantic fisheries,
arable land, and large oil deposits - Angola will need to observe the cease-fire,
implement the peace agreement, and reform government policies. Despite the
high inflation and political difficulties, total output grew an estimated
9% in 1996, largely due to increased oil production.
