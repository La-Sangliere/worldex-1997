<p>
<b>Location:</b> Northern North America, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean and North
Pacific Ocean, north of the conterminous US

<p>

<b>Economy - overview:</b> As an affluent, high-tech industrial society, Canada today closely resembles
the US in per capita output, market-oriented economic system, and pattern
of production. Since World War II, the impressive growth of the manufacturing,
mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural
economy into one primarily industrial and urban. Canada started the 1990s
in recession, and real rates of growth have averaged only 1.1% so far this
decade. Because of slower growth, Canada still faces high unemployment - especially
in Quebec and the Maritime Provinces - and a large public sector debt. With
its great natural resources, skilled labor force, and modern capital plant,
however, Canada will enjoy better economic prospects in the future. The continuing
constitutional impasse between English- and French-speaking areas is raising
the possibility of a split in the confederation, making foreign investors
somewhat edgy.
