<b>Economy - overview:</b> Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural resources, but exploitation
has been hampered by the rugged terrain and the high cost of developing an
 infrastructure. Agriculture provides a subsistence livelihood for the bulk
of the population. Mineral deposits, including oil, copper, and gold, account
for 72% of export earnings. Budgetary support from Australia and development
aid under World Bank auspices have helped sustain the economy. In 1995, Port
Moresby reached agreement with the IMF and World Bank on a structural adjustment
program, of which the first phase was successfully completed in 1996. A second
phase structural adjustment loan will be negotiated in 1997. The structural
adjustment program includes liberalization of trade and investment policies,
sustainable development of the forestry sector, improvement of government
planning capacity and better delivery of public services. New gold and oil
projects are under development and planned to begin production in 1997 and
1998 respectively.
