<b>Economy - overview:</b> Slovenia appears to be making a solid economic recovery, fulfilling
the promise it showed at the time of Yugoslavia's breakup. Its per capita
GDP is now the highest in Central and Eastern Europe and comparable to the
 levels in the poorer West European countries. Slovenia has benefited from
strong ties to Western Europe and suffered comparatively small physical damage
during Yugoslavia's breakup. The beginning was difficult, however. Real GDP
fell 15% in 1991-92, while inflation soared to 200% in 1992. The turning point
came in 1993, when real GDP grew 1%, unemployment leveled off, and inflation
slowed dramatically. In 1994, real GDP rose 5.5%, tapering off to an estimated
3.5% in 1995 and an estimated 3% in 1996. The government gets good marks from
foreign observers for fiscal policy - the budget deficit has not exceeded
1% of GDP in any year since 1991, and the current account balance has remained
in surplus throughout the transition period, with the exception of 1995-96.
The Slovene privatization program, which began in 1994, involves about 1,400
firms, but less than half have been privatized. Growth in the near term depends
largely on economic revitalization in Western Europe which buys 70% of Slovenia's
exports. Slovenia itself must press on with privatization, restructuring,
the encouragement of foreign investment, and the maintenance of a stable tolar.
