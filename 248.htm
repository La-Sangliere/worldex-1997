<b>Economy - overview:</b> Tuvalu consists of a densely populated, scattered group of nine coral
atolls with poor soil. The country has no known mineral resources and few
exports. Subsistence farming and fishing are the primary economic activities.
The islands are too small and too remote for development of a large-scale
tourist industry. Government revenues largely come from the sale of stamps
and coins and worker remittances. About 1,000 Tuvaluans work in Nauru in the
phosphate mining industry. Nauru has begun repatriating Tuvaluans, however,
as phosphate resources decline, which will present additional problems for
Tuvalu's already stretched economy. Substantial income is received annually
from an international trust fund established in 1987 by Australia, NZ, and
the UK and supported also by Japan and South Korea. In an effort to reduce
its dependence on foreign aid, the government is pursuing public sector reforms,
including privatization of some government functions and personnel cuts of
up to 7%.
