<p>
<b>Economy - overview:</b> Government-industry cooperation, a strong work ethic, mastery of high
technology, and a comparatively small defense allocation (roughly 1% of GDP)
have helped Japan advance with extraordinary rapidity to the rank of second
most powerful economy in the world. One notable characteristic of the economy
is the working together of manufacturers, suppliers, and distributors in closely
knit groups called keiretsu. A second basic feature has been the guarantee
of lifetime employment for a substantial portion of the urban labor force;
this guarantee is slowly eroding. Industry, the most important sector of the
economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and fuels. The much
smaller agricultural sector is highly subsidized and protected, with crop
yields among the highest in the world. Usually self-sufficient in rice, Japan
must import about 50% of its requirements of other grain and fodder crops.
Japan maintains one of the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for
nearly 15% of the global catch. For three decades overall real economic growth
had been spectacular: a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s,
and a 4% average in the 1980s. Growth slowed considerably in 1992-95 largely
because of the aftereffects of overinvestment during the late 1980s and contractionary
domestic policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the stock and
real estate markets. Growth picked up in 1996, largely a reflection of stimulative
fiscal and monetary policies as well as low rates of inflation and social
disorder. As a result of the expansionary fiscal policies and declining tax
revenues due to the recession, Japan currently has one of the largest budget
deficits as a percent of GDP among the industrialized countries. The crowding
of habitable land area and the aging of the population are two other major
long-run problems.
