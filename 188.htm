<p>
<b>Location:</b> body of water between Antarctica, Asia, Australia, and the Western Hemisphere


<p>
<b>Geographic coordinates:</b> 0 00 N, 160 00 W 

<p>
<b>Map references:</b> World 

<p>
<b>Area:</b> 
<br><i>total:</i> 165.384 million sq km 
<br><i>note:</i> includes Bali Sea, Bellingshausen Sea, Bering Sea, Bering Strait, Coral
Sea, East China Sea, Flores Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Gulf of Tonkin, Java Sea,
 Philippine Sea, Ross Sea, Savu Sea, Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, South China
Sea, Tasman Sea, Timor Sea, and other tributary water bodies

<p>
<b>Area - comparative:</b> about 18 times the size of the US; the largest ocean (followed by the
Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean); covers about one-third
of the global surface; larger than the total land area of the world

<p>
<b>Coastline:</b> 135,663 km 

<p>
<b>Climate:</b> planetary air pressure systems and resultant wind patterns exhibit remarkable
uniformity in the south and east; trade winds and westerly winds are well-developed
patterns, modified by seasonal fluctuations; tropical cyclones (hurricanes)
may form south of Mexico from June to October and affect Mexico and Central
America; continental influences cause climatic uniformity to be much less
pronounced in the eastern and western regions at the same latitude in the
North Pacific Ocean; the western Pacific is monsoonal - a rainy season occurs
during the summer months, when moisture-laden winds blow from the ocean over
the land, and a dry season during the winter months, when dry winds blow from
the Asian land mass back to the ocean; tropical cyclones (typhoons) may strike
southeast and East Asia from May to December

<p>
<b>Terrain:</b> surface currents in the northern Pacific are dominated by a clockwise,
warm-water gyre (broad circular system of currents) and in the southern Pacific
by a counterclockwise, cool-water gyre; in the northern Pacific, sea ice forms
in the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk in winter; in the southern Pacific, sea
ice from Antarctica reaches its northernmost extent in October; the ocean
floor in the eastern Pacific is dominated by the East Pacific Rise, while
the western Pacific is dissected by deep trenches, including the Marianas
Trench, which is the world's deepest

<p>
<b>Elevation extremes:</b> 
<br><i>lowest point:</i> Marianas Trench -10,924 m 
<br><i>highest point:</i> sea level 0 m 

<p>
<b>Natural resources:</b> oil and gas fields, polymetallic nodules, sand and gravel aggregates,
placer deposits, fish 

<p>
<b>Natural hazards:</b> surrounded by a zone of violent volcanic and earthquake activity sometimes
referred to as the "Pacific Ring of Fire"; subject to tropical cyclones (typhoons)
in southeast and east Asia from May to December (most frequent from July to
October); tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico and strike
Central America and Mexico from June to October (most common in August and
September); southern shipping lanes subject to icebergs from Antarctica; occasional
El Nino phenomenon occurs off the coast of Peru, when the trade winds slacken
and the warm Equatorial Countercurrent moves south, killing the plankton that
is the primary food source for anchovies; consequently, the anchovies move
to better feeding grounds, causing resident marine birds to starve by the
thousands because of the loss of their food source; ships subject to superstructure
icing in extreme north from October to May and in extreme south from May to
October; persistent fog in the northern Pacific can be a maritime hazard from
June to December

<p>
<b>Environment - current issues:</b> endangered marine species include the dugong, sea lion, sea otter, seals,
turtles, and whales; oil pollution in Philippine Sea and South China Sea

<p>
<b>Environment - international agreements:</b> 
<br><i>party to :</i> none of the selected agreements
<br><i>signed, but not ratified:</i> none of the selected agreements

<p>
<b>Geography - note:</b> the major choke points are the Bering Strait, Panama Canal, Luzon Strait,
and the Singapore Strait; the Equator divides the Pacific Ocean into the North
Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean; dotted with low coral islands and
rugged volcanic islands in the southwestern Pacific Ocean

<b>Economy - overview:</b> The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world economy and particularly
to those nations its waters directly touch. It provides low-cost sea transportation
between East and West, extensive fishing grounds, offshore oil and gas fields,
minerals, and sand and gravel for the construction industry. In 1985 over
half (54%) of the world's fish catch came from the Pacific Ocean, which is
the only ocean where the fish catch has increased every year since 1978. Exploitation
of offshore oil and gas reserves is playing an ever-increasing role in the
energy supplies of Australia, NZ, China, US, and Peru. The high cost of recovering
offshore oil and gas, combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil
since 1985, has slowed but not stopped new drillings.
