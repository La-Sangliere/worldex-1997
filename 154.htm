<b>Economy - overview:</b> During the 1980s tourism became one of the most important and highest
growth sectors of the economy. In 1994, tourism, Maldives largest industry,
accounted for about 18% of GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign
exchange receipts. Fishing is a second leading growth sector. Over 90% of
government tax revenue comes from import duties and tourism-related taxes.
The Maldivian Government initiated an economic reform program in 1989 initially
by lifting import quotas and opening some exports to the private sector. Subsequently,
it has liberalized regulations to allow more foreign investment. Agriculture
and manufacturing continue to play a minor role in the economy, constrained
by the limited availability of cultivable land and the shortage of domestic
labor. Most staple foods must be imported. In 1994, industry which consisted
mainly of garment production, boat building, and handicrafts accounted for
about 15% of GDP.
