<b>Economy - overview:</b> Greenland suffered negative economic growth in the early 1990s, but
since 1993 the economy has improved. Nonetheless, prospects for substantial
economic growth in the near future are poor. The Greenland Home Rule Government
(GHRG) has pursued a light fiscal policy since the late 1980s which has helped
create surpluses in the public budget and low inflation. Since 1990, Greenland
has registered a foreign trade deficit following the closure of the last remaining
lead and zinc mine in 1989. Greenland today is critically dependent on fishing
and fish exports; the shrimp fishery is by far the largest income earner.
Despite resumption of several interesting hydrocarbon and minerals exploration
activities, it will take several years before production can materialize.
Tourism is the only sector offering any near term potential and even this
is limited due to a short season and high costs. The public sector, including
publicly owned enterprises and the municipalities, plays the dominant role
in Greenland's economy. About half the government revenues come from grants
from the Danish Government, an important supplement of GDP.
