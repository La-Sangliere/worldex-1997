<b>Economy - overview:</b> Agriculture and tourism are the mainstays of the economy. Agricultural
production is concentrated on small farms, and the most important commercial
crops are coconuts, tomatoes, melons, and breadfruit. Small-scale industry
is limited to handicrafts, fish processing, and copra. The tourist industry
is the primary source of foreign exchange, employs about 10% of the labor
force, and remains the best hope for future added income. The islands have
few natural resources, and imports far exceed exports. The government is drafting
economic reforms designed to increase revenue and compensate for reductions
in US Government grants - in 1994, the US Government provided grants of $50
million, equal to 55% of the Marshall Islands' GDP. About 25% of the government's
FY95/96 budget was devoted to debt repayment. In 1996, efforts to stabilize
the economy included a 27% reduction in the government's work force and a
10% cut in the budget.
