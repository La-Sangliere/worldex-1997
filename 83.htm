<b>Economy - overview:</b> The Faroese economy in 1995 and 1996 saw a noticeable upturn after several
years of decline brought on by a drop in fish catches and declining prices
and by over-spending by the Faroese Home Rule Government (FHRG). In the early
1990s, property values plummeted, and the FHRG had to bail out and merge the
two largest Faroese banks. Fishing is now improving; wage costs are increasing;
the FHRG's budget is almost in balance; and the large foreign debt has come
down significantly. Nevertheless, the total dependence on fishing makes the
Faroese economy extremely vulnerable, and the reduction in the foreign debt
is at the cost of low investment. Oil finds close to the Faroese area give
hope for deposits in the immediate Faroese area, which may lay the basis for
an eventual economic rebound. Aided by a substantial annual subsidy from Denmark,
the Faroese have a standard of living comparable to the Danes and other Scandinavians.
