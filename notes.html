<P>There have been some significant changes in this edition. A schema or
Guide to Country Profiles has been added. The new maps and flags accompanying
each country profile are in color. The country name Zaire has been officially
changed to Democratic Republic of the Congo. Congo is now referred to as Republic
of the Congo. New reference maps of the United States, Ethnolinguistic Groups
in Afghanistan, and Central Africa have been included. Introduction is a new
category with two entries--Current issues and Historical perspective that now
appear in only a few country profiles, but will be added to all countries
in the future. The Area--comparative entry was separated from the Area entry.
The lowest point and highest point information has been removed from the Terrain
entry and put into a new entry called Elevation extremes. The former Environment
entry has been replaced by three new entries--Natural hazards, Environment--current
issues, and Environment--international agreements. US diplomatic representation
has been renamed Diplomatic representation from the US in order to parallel
the Diplomatic representation in the US entry. The former Airports entry has
been split into three separate entries--Airports, Airports--with paved runways,
and Airports--with unpaved runways. The Defense category has been renamed Military.
The Branches entry has been renamed Military branches. The former Manpower
availability entry has been replaced by four new entries--Military manpower--military
age, Military manpower--availability, Military manpower--fit for military service,
and Military manpower--reaching military age annually. The former Defense expenditures
entry has been replaced by two new entries--Military expenditures--dollar figure,
and Military expenditures--percent of GDP. Transnational Issues is a new category
that now includes only two existing entries (Illicit drugs and Disputes--international)
but additional entries will be considered in the future. 
<P>
<strong>Abbreviations:</strong> This information is included in Appendix A: Abbreviations which includes
all abbreviations and acronyms used in the Factbook with their expansions.

<P>
<strong>Administrative divisions:</strong>  This entry generally gives the numbers, designatory terms, and first-order
administrative divisions as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names (BGN).
Changes that have been reported but not yet acted on by BGN are noted.
<P>
<strong>Age structure:</strong> This entry provides the distribution of the population according to
age. Information is included by sex and age group (0-14 years, 15-64 years,
65 years and over). The age structure of a population will affect a country's
investment pattern. Countries with young populations (high percentage under
age 15) need to invest more in schools, while countries with older populations
(high percentage ages 65 and over) need to invest more in the health sector.
The age structure can also be used to help predict potential political issues.
For example, the rapid growth of a young adult population unable to find employment
can lead to unrest.
<P>
<strong>Agriculture--products:</strong> This entry is a rank ordering of major crops and products starting with
the most important.
<P>
<strong>Airports:</strong> This entry gives the total number of airports. The runway(s) may be
paved (concrete or asphalt surfaces) or unpaved (grass, dirt, sand, or gravel
surfaces), but must be usable. Not all airports have facilities for refueling,
maintenance, or air traffic control.
<P>
<strong>Airports--with paved runways:</strong> This entry gives the total number of airports with paved runways (concrete
or asphalt surfaces). For airports with more than one runway, only the longest
runway is included according to the following five groups--(1) over 3,047 m,
(2) 2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523 m, and (5) under
914 m. Not all airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air
traffic control. Only airports with usable runways are included in this listing.

<P>
<strong>Airports--with unpaved runways:</strong> This entry gives the total number of airports with unpaved runways (grass,
dirt, sand, or gravel surfaces). For airports with more than one runway, only
the longest runway is included according to the following five groups--(1)
over 3,047 m, (2) 2,438 to 3,047 m, (3) 1,524 to 2,437 m, (4) 914 to 1,523
m, and (5) under 914 m. Not all airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance,
or air traffic control. Only airports with usable runways are included in
this listing.
<P>
<strong>Appendixes:</strong> This section includes <I>Factbook</I>-related material by topic. Area: This
entry includes three subfields. Total area is the sum of all land and water
areas delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines. Land area is
the aggregate of all surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or
coastlines, excluding inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Water
area is the sum of all water surfaces delimited by international boundaries
and/or coastlines, including inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers).

<P>
<strong>Area--comparative:</strong> This entry provides an area comparison based on total area equivalents.
Most entities are compared with the entire US or one of the 50 states based
on area measurements (1990 revised) provided by the US Bureau of the Census.
The smaller entities are compared with Washington, DC (178 sq km, 69 sq mi)
or The Mall in Washington, DC (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi, 146 acres).
<P>
<strong>Birth rate:</strong> This entry gives the average annual number of births during a year per
1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude birth rate. The birth rate
is usually the dominant factor in determining the rate of population growth.
It depends on both the level of fertility and the age structure of the population.

<P>
<strong>Budget:</strong> This entry includes revenues, total expenditures, and capital expenditures.

<P>
<strong>Climate:</strong> This entry includes a brief description of typical weather regimes throughout
the year.
<P>
<strong>Coastline:</strong> This entry gives the total length of the boundary between the land area
(including islands) and the sea.
<P>
<strong>Communications:</strong> This category deals with the means of exchanging information and includes
the radio, telephone, and television entries.
<P>
<strong>Communications--note:</strong> This entry includes miscellaneous communications information of significance
not included elsewhere.
<P>
<strong>Constitution:</strong> This entry includes the dates of adoption, revisions, and major amendments.

<P>
<strong>Country map:</strong> Most versions of the Factbook provide a country map in color. The maps
were produced from the best information available at the time of preparation.
Names and/or boundaries may have changed subsequently.
<P>
<strong>Country name:</strong> This entry includes all forms of the country's name approved by the
US Board on Geographic Names (Italy is used as an example): conventional long
form (Italian Republic), conventional short form (Italy), local long form
(Repubblica Italiana), local short form (Italia), former (Kingdom of Italy),
as well as the abbreviation. See the Terminology note regarding the use of
the term "country." 
<P>
<strong>Currency:</strong> This entry identifies the local medium of exchange and its basic subunit.

<P>
<strong>Current issues:</strong> This entry briefly characterizes major geographic, social, political,
and military developments in the past 12 months and may include a statement
about one or two key future trends. This entry appears for only a few countries
at the present time, but will be added to all countries in the future. 
<P>
<strong>Data code:</strong> This entry gives the official US Government digraph that precisely identifies
every land entity without overlap, duplication, or omission. AF, for example,
is the data code for Afghanistan. This two-letter country code is a standardized
geopolitical data element promulgated in the Federal Information Processing
Standards Publication (FIPS) 10-4 by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology at the US Department of Commerce and maintained by the Office of
the Geographer and Global Issues at the US Department of State. The data code
is used to eliminate confusion and incompatibility in the collection, processing,
and dissemination of area-specific data and is particularly useful for interchanging
data between databases. Appendix F cross-references various country codes
and Appendix G does the same thing for hydrographic codes. Data codes-country:
This information is presented in Appendix F: Cross-Reference List of Country
Data Codes which includes the US Government approved Federal Information Processing
Standards (FIPS), the International Organization for Standardization (ISO),
and Internet country codes.
<P>
<strong>Data codes--hydrographic:</strong> This information is presented in Appendix G: Cross-Reference List of
Hydrographic Data Codes which includes the International Hydrographic Organization
(IHO), Aeronautical Chart and Information Center (ACIC; now National Imagery
and Mapping Agency or NIMA), and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) hydrographic
codes. The US Government has not yet approved a standard for hydrographic
data codes similar to the FIPS 10-4 standard for country data codes. 
<P>
<strong>Dates of information:</strong> The information cutoff date was 1 January 1997, although a few important
changes after that date have been included. Most demographic statistics are
estimates for 1997. 
<P>
<strong>Death rate:</strong> This entry gives the average annual number of deaths during a year per
1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude death rate. The death rate,
while only a rough indicator of the mortality situation in a country, accurately
indicates the current mortality impact on population growth. This indicator
is significantly affected by the age distribution, and most countries will
eventually show a rise in the rate, in spite of continued declines in mortality
at all ages, as declining fertility results in an aging population. 
<P>
<strong>Debt--external:</strong> This entry gives the total amount of public foreign financial obligations. 

<P>
<strong>Dependency status:</strong> This entry describes the formal relationship between a nonindependent
entity and a sovereign nation.
<P>
<strong>Dependent areas:</strong> This entry contains an alphabetical listing of all nonindependent entities
associated in some way with a particular sovereign nation. 
<P>
<strong>Diplomatic representation:</strong> The US Government has diplomatic relations with 184 nations, including
178 of the 185 UN members (excluded UN members are Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Iraq,
North Korea, former Yugoslavia, and the US itself). In addition, the US has
diplomatic relations with 6 nations that are not in the UN--Holy See, Kiribati,
Nauru, Switzerland, Tonga, and Tuvalu. Diplomatic representation from the
US: This entry includes the chief of mission, embassy address, mailing address,
telephone number, FAX number, branch office locations, consulate general locations,
and consulate locations. Diplomatic representation in the US: This entry includes
the chief of mission, chancery address, telephone number, FAX number, consulate
general locations, consulate locations, honorary consulate general locations,
and honorary consulate locations. 
<P>
<strong>Disputes--international:</strong> This entry includes a wide variety of situations that range from traditional
bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral claims of one sort or another. Information
regarding disputes over international terrestrial and maritime boundaries
has been reviewed by the US Department of State. References to other situations
involving borders or frontiers may also be included, such as resource disputes,
geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues, however, inclusion does not
necessarily constitute official acceptance or recognition by the US Government. 

<P>
<strong>Economic aid:</strong> This entry refers to bilateral commitments of official development assistance
(ODA) and other official flows (OOF). ODA is defined as financial assistance
which is concessional in character, has the main objective to promote economic
development and welfare of LDCs, and contains a grant element of at least
25%. OOF transactions are also official government assistance, but with a
main objective other than economic development and with a grant element less
than 25%. OOF transactions include official export credits (such as Ex-Im
Bank credits), official equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization
by the official sector that does not meet concessional terms. Aid is considered
to have been committed when agreements are initialed by the parties involved
and constitute a formal declaration of intent. The entry is separated into
two components--donor and recipient. 
<P>
<strong>Economy:</strong> This category includes the entries dealing with the size, development,
and management of productive resources, i.e., land, labor, and capital. 


<P>
<STRONG>Economy--overview:</STRONG> This entry briefly describes the type of economy, including the degree of
market orientation, the level of economic development, the most important
natural resources, and the unique areas of specialization. It also characterizes
major economic events and policy changes in the most recent 12 months and
may include a statement about one or two key future macroeconomic trends. 

<P>
<strong>Electricity--capacity:</strong> This entry gives the maximum designed potential for electricity production
expressed in kilowatts.
<P>
<strong>Electricity--consumption per capita:</strong> This entry gives the figure for annual electricity generation plus net
imports or minus net exports, divided by total population for the same year
expressed in kilowatt hours. 
<P>
<strong>Electricity--production:</strong> This entry gives the annual amount of electricity actually generated
expressed in kilowatt hours. 
<P>
<strong>Elevation extremes:</strong> This entry includes both the highest point and the lowest point. 
<P>
<strong>Entities:</strong> Some of the nations, dependent areas, areas of special sovereignty,
and governments included in this publication are not independent, and others
are not officially recognized by the US Government. "Nation" refers to a people
politically organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory. "Dependent
area" refers to a broad category of political entities that are associated
in some way with a nation. "Country" names used in the table of contents or
for page headings are usually the short-form names as approved by the US Board
on Geographic Names and may include nations, dependencies, or other geographic
entities. There are a total of 266 separate geographic entities in <I>The World
Factbook</I> that may be categorized as follows:

currency per US dollar and as determined by international market forces or
official fiat. 
<P>
<strong>Executive branch:</strong> This entry includes several subfields. Chief of state includes the name
and title of the titular leader of the country who represents the state at
official and ceremonial functions but may not be involved with the day-to-day
activities of the government. Head of government includes the name and title

and the method of selection for members. Elections includes the nature of
election process or accession to power, date of the last election, and date
of the next election. Election results includes the percent of vote for each
candidate in the last election. In the UK, the monarch is the chief of state,
and the prime minister is the head of government. In the US, the President
is both the chief of state and the head of government.
<P>
<strong>Exports:</strong> This entry includes three subfields. Total value is the total US dollar
amount of exports on an f.o.b. basis. Commodities is a rank ordering of exported
products starting with the most important and sometimes includes the percent

<P>
<strong>Fiscal year:</strong> This entry identifies the beginning and ending months for a country's
accounting period of 12 months, which often is the calendar year but may begin
in any month. FY93/94 refers to the fiscal year that began in calendar year
1993 and ended in calendar year 1994. All yearly references are for the calendar
year (CY) unless indicated as a noncalendar fiscal year (FY).  
<P>
<strong>Flag description:</strong> This entry provides a written flag description produced from actual
flags or the best information available at the time the entry was written.
The flags of independent nations are used by their dependencies unless there
is an officially recognized local flag. Some disputed and other areas do not
have flags.  
<P>
<strong>Flag graphic:</strong> Most versions of the Factbook provide a color flag available at the
beginning of the country entry. The flag graphics were produced from actual
flags or the best information available at the time of preparation. The flags
of independent nations are used by their dependencies unless there is an officially
recognized local flag. Some disputed and other areas do not have flags.  

<P>
<strong>GDP:</strong> This entry gives the gross domestic product (GDP) or value of all final
goods and services produced within a nation in a given year. GDP dollar estimates
in the Factbook are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations.
See the note on GDP methodology for more information.
<P>
<strong>GDP methodology:</strong> In the Economy section, GDP dollar estimates for all countries are derived
from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations rather than from conversions
at official currency exchange rates. The PPP method involves the use of standardized
international dollar price weights, which are applied to the quantities of
final goods and services produced in a given economy. The data derived from
the PPP method provide a better comparison of economic well-being between
countries. The division of a GDP estimate in domestic currency by the corresponding
PPP estimate in dollars gives the PPP conversion rate. When converted at PPP
rates, $1,000 will buy the same market basket of goods in any country. Whereas
PPP estimates for OECD countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing
countries are often rough approximations. Most of the GDP estimates are based
on extrapolation of PPP numbers published by the UN International Comparison
Program (UNICP) and by Professors Robert Summers and Alan Heston of the University
of Pennsylvania and their colleagues. In contrast, currency exchange rates
depend on a variety of international and domestic financial forces that often
have little relation to domestic output. In developing countries with weak
currencies the exchange rate estimate of GDP in dollars is typically one-fourth
to one-half the PPP estimate. Furthermore, exchange rates may suddenly go
up or down by 10% or more because of market forces or official fiat whereas
real output has remained unchanged. On 12 January 1994, for example, the 14
countries of the African Financial Community (whose currencies are tied to
the French franc) devalued their currencies by 50%. This move, of course,
did not cut the real output of these countries by half. One important caution:
the proportion of, say, defense expenditures as a percentage of GDP in local
currency accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when GDP accounts
are expressed in PPP terms, as, for example, when an observer tries to estimate
the dollar level of Russian or Japanese military expenditures. Note: the numbers
for GDP and other economic data can not be chained together from successive
volumes of the Factbook because of changes in the US dollar measuring rod,
revisions of data by statistical agencies, use of new or different sources
of information, and changes in national statistical methods and practices.
For statistical series on GDP and other economic variables, see the <a href="http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/hies97/index.htm" target="_top"><I>Handbook
of International Economic Statistics</I></A> available from the same sources as The

the future.
<P>
<strong>Illicit drugs:</strong> This entry gives information on the five categories of illicit drugs--narcotics,
stimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, and cannabis. These categories
include many drugs legally produced and prescribed by doctors as well as those
illegally produced and sold outside of medical channels. 
<P>Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which provides
hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana (pot,
Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, Marinol), hashish
(hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).  
<P>Coca (mostly Erythroxylum coca) is a bush with leaves that contain the
stimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa, which
comes from cacao seeds and is used in making chocolate, cocoa, and cocoa butter.
 
<P>Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.  
<P>Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and
include chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal, phenobarbital),
benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone (Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden),
and others (Equanil, Placidyl, Valmid).  
<P>Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental, emotional,

and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot), mescaline and peyote
(mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine variants (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine
(PCP, angel dust, hog), phencyclidine analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others
(psilocybin, psilocyn).  
<P>Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis
sativa).  
<P>Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.  
<P>Mandrax is a trade name for methaqualone, a pharmaceutical depressant.
 
<P>Marijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis
sativa).  
<P>Methaqualone is a pharmaceutical depressant, referred to as mandrax
in Southwest Asia.  
<P>Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer
to opium, opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics
include opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol), codeine
(Tylenol with codeine, Empirin with codeine, Robitussan AC), and thebaine.
Semisynthetic narcotics include heroin (horse, smack), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid).
Synthetic narcotics include meperidine or Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan), methadone
(Dolophine, Methadose), and others (Darvon, Lomotil).

with the previous year's consumer prices.  
<P>
<strong>International disputes:</strong> see Disputes--international  
<P>

organizations in which the subject country is a member or participates in
some other way.  
<P>
<strong>International organizations:</strong> This information is presented in Appendix C: International Organizations
and Groups which includes the name, abbreviation, address, telephone, FAX,
date established, aim, and members by category.  
<P>
<strong>Introduction:</strong> This category includes two entries--Current issues and Historical perspective.
 
<P>
<strong>Irrigated land:</strong> This entry gives the number of square kilometers of land area that is
artificially supplied with water.  
<P>
<strong>Judicial branch:</strong> This entry contains the name(s) of the highest court(s) and a brief
description of the selection process for members.  
<P>
<strong>Labor force:</strong> This entry contains the total labor force figure and a rank ordering
of component parts by occupation.  
<P>
<strong>Land boundaries:</strong> This entry contains the total length of all land boundaries and the
individual lengths for each of the contiguous border countries.  
<P>
<strong>Land use:</strong> This entry contains the percentage shares of total land area for five
different types of land use. Arable land--land cultivated for crops that are
replanted after each harvest like wheat, maize, and rice. Permanent crops--land
cultivated for crops that are not replanted after each harvest like citrus,
coffee, and rubber. Permanent pastures--land permanently used for herbaceous
forage crops. Forests and woodland--land under dense or open stands of trees.
Other--any land type not specifically mentioned above like urban areas, roads,
desert, etc.  
<P>
<strong>Languages:</strong> This entry provides a rank ordering of languages starting with the largest
and sometimes includes the percent of total population speaking that language.
 
<P>

roots, role in government, and acceptance of International Court of Justice
(ICJ) jurisdiction.
<P>
<strong>Legislative branch:</strong> This entry contains information on the structure (unicameral, bicameral,
tricameral), formal name, number of seats, and term of office. Elections includes
the nature of election process or accession to power, date of the last election,
and date of the next election. Election results includes the percent of vote
and/or number of seats held by each party in the last election.  
<P>
<strong>Life expectancy at birth:</strong> This entry contains the average number of years to be lived by a group
of people born in the same year, if mortality at each age remains constant
in the future. The entry includes total population as well as the male and
female components. Life expectancy at birth is also a measure of overall quality
of life in a country and summarizes the mortality at all ages. It can also
be thought of as indicating the potential return on investment in human capital,
and is necessary for the calculation of various actuarial measures. 
<P>
<strong>Literacy:</strong> This entry includes a definition of literacy and Census Bureau percentages
for the total population, males, and females. There are no universal definitions
and standards of literacy. Unless otherwise specified, all rates are based
on the most common definition--the ability to read and write at a specified
age. Detailing the standards that individual countries use to assess the ability
to read and write is beyond the scope of the Factbook. Information on literacy,
while not a perfect measure of educational results, is probably the most easily
available and valid for international comparisons. Low levels of literacy,
and education in general, can impede the economic development of a country
in the current rapidly changing, technology-driven world. 
<P>
<strong>Location:</strong> This entry identifies the country's regional location, neighboring countries,
and adjacent bodies of water.
<P>
<strong>Map references:</strong> This entry includes the name of the Factbook reference map on which
a country may be found. The entry on Geographic coordinates may be helpful
in finding some smaller countries. 
<P>
<strong>Maritime claims:</strong> This entry includes the following claims: contiguous zone, continental
shelf, exclusive economic zone, exclusive fishing zone, extended fishing zone,
none (usually for a landlocked country), other (unique maritime claims like
Libya's Gulf of Sidra Closing Line or North Korea's Military Boundary Line),
and territorial sea. The proximity of neighboring states may prevent some
national claims from being extended the full distance. 
<P>
<strong>Merchant marine:</strong> Merchant marine may be defined as all ships engaged in the carriage
of goods; all commercial vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships) which
excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc.; or a grouping of
merchant ships by nationality or register. This entry contains information
in two subfields--total and ships by type. Total includes the total number
of ships (1,000 GRT or over), total DWT for all ships, and total GRT for all
ships. Ships by type includes a listing of barge carriers, bulk cargo ships,
cargo ships, combination bulk carriers, combination ore/oil carriers, container
ships, intermodal ships, liquefied gas tankers, livestock carriers, multifunction
large-load carriers, oil tankers, passenger ships, passenger-cargo ships,
railcar carriers, refrigerated cargo ships, roll-on/roll-off cargo ships,
short-sea passenger ships, specialized tankers, tanker tug-barges, and vehicle
carriers.   
<P>Captive register is a register of ships maintained by a territory, possession,
or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships owned in the parent
country; also referred to as an offshore register, the offshore equivalent
of an internal register. Ships on a captive register will fly the same flag
as the parent country, or a local variant of it, but will be subject to the
maritime laws and taxation rules of the offshore territory. Although the nature
of a captive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the
parent country, just as in the internal register, the ships may also be owned
abroad. The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience register,
except that it is not the register of an independent state.  
<P>Flag of convenience register is a national register offering registration
to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major flags of convenience
(FOC) attract ships to their registers by virtue of low fees, low or nonexistent
taxation of profits, and liberal manning requirements. True FOC registers
are characterized by having relatively few of the registered ships actually
owned in the flag state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships
under a given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority
of the merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to as an open register.
 
<P>Flag state is the nation in which a ship is registered and which holds
legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home or abroad.
Maritime legislation of the flag state determines how a ship is crewed and
taxed and whether a foreign-owned ship may be placed on the register.  
<P>Internal register is a register of ships maintained as a subset of a
national register. Ships on the internal register fly the national flag and
have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of maritime rules
from those on the main national register. These differences usually include
lower taxation of profits, use of foreign nationals as crew members, and,
usually, ownership outside the flag state (when it functions as an FOC register).
The Norwegian International Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register
are the most notable examples of an internal register. Both have been instrumental
in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of convenience and in attracting
foreign-owned ships to the Norwegian and Danish flags.  
<P>Merchant ship is a vessel that carries goods against payment of freight;
commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately restricted to
commercial vessels only.  
<P>Register is the record of a ship's ownership and nationality as listed
with the maritime authorities of a country; also, the compendium of such individual
ships' registrations. Registration of a ship provides it with a nationality
and makes it subject to the laws of the country in which registered (the flag
state) regardless of the nationality of the ship's ultimate owner.  
<P>
<strong>Military:</strong> This category includes the entries dealing with a country's military
structure, manpower, and expenditures. 
<P>
<strong>Military branches:</strong> This entry lists the names of the ground, naval, air, marine, and other
defense or military-type forces.  
<P>
<strong>Military expenditures--dollar figure:</strong> This entry gives current military expenditures in US dollars; the figure
is calculated by multiplying the estimated defense spending in percentage
terms by the gross domestic product (GDP) in purchasing power parity (PPP)
terms. The figure should be treated with caution because of different price
patterns and accounting methods among nations.  
<P>
<strong>Military expenditures--percent of GDP:</strong> This entry gives current military expenditures as an estimated percent
of gross domestic product (GDP).  
<P>
<strong>Military manpower--availability:</strong> This entry gives the total numbers of males and females age 15-49 and
assumes that every individual is fit to serve.  
<P>
<strong>Military manpower--fit for military service:</strong> This entry gives the number of males and females age 15-49 fit for military
service. This is a more refined measure of potential military manpower availability
which tries to correct for the health situation in the country and reduces
the maximum potential number to a more realistic estimate of the actual number
fit to serve.  
<P>
<strong>Military manpower--military age:</strong> This entry gives the minimum age at which an individual may volunteer
for military service or be subject to conscription.  
<P>
<strong>Military manpower--reaching military age annually:</strong> This entry gives the number of draft-age males and females entering
the military manpower pool in any given year and is a measure of the availability
of draft-age young adults.  
<P>
<strong>Military--note:</strong> This entry includes miscellaneous military information of significance
not included elsewhere.  
<P>

<P>
<strong>Natural resources:</strong> This entry lists a country's mineral, petroleum, hydropower, and other
resources of commercial importance.  
<P>
<strong>Net migration rate:</strong> This entry includes the figure for the difference between the number
of persons entering and leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons
(based on midyear population). An excess of persons entering the country is
referred to as net immigration (e.g., 3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an
excess of persons leaving the country as net emigration (e.g., -9.26 migrants/1,000
population). The net migration rate indicates the contribution of migration
to the overall level of population change. High levels of migration can cause
problems such as increasing unemployment and potential ethnic strife (if people
are coming in) or reducing the labor force, perhaps in certain key sectors
(if people are leaving).  
<P>
<strong>People:</strong> This category includes the entries dealing with the characteristics
of the people and their society.  
<P>
<strong>People--note:</strong> This entry includes miscellaneous demographic information of significance
not included elsewhere.  
<P>
<strong>Pipelines:</strong> This entry gives the lengths and types of pipelines for transporting
products like natural gas, crude oil, or petroleum products.  
<P>
<strong>Political parties and leaders:</strong> This entry includes a listing of political organizations and their leaders.
 
<P>
<strong>Political pressure groups and leaders:</strong> This entry includes a listing of organizations with leaders involved
in politics, but not standing for legislative election.  
<P>
<strong>Population:</strong> This entry gives an estimate from the US Bureau of the Census based
on statistics from population censuses, vital statistics registration systems,
or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past, and on assumptions about
future trends. Starting with the 1993 Factbook, demographic estimates for
some countries (mostly African) have taken into account the effects of the
growing incidence of AIDS infections; in 1997 these countries were Botswana,
Brazil, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Republic
of the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Guyana, Haiti, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi,
Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, Zaire which is
now known as Democratic Republic of the Congo, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The total
population presents one overall measure of the potential impact of the country
on the world and within its region.  
<P>
<strong>Population growth rate:</strong> The average annual percent change in the population, resulting from
a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance of migrants entering
and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or negative. Also known as
growth rate or average annual rate of growth. The growth rate is a factor
in determining how rapidly a country responds to the changing needs of its
people in terms of infrastructure (e.g., schools, hospitals, housing, roads),
resources (e.g., food, water, electricity), and jobs. Rapid population growth
can also be seen as threatening by neighboring countries.  
<P>
<strong>Ports and harbors:</strong> This entry lists a few ports and harbors selected on the basis of overall
importance to each country. This is determined by evaluating a number of factors
(e.g., dollar value of goods handled, gross tonnage, facilities, military
significance).  
<P>
<strong>Radio broadcast stations:</strong> This entry includes the total number of AM, FM, and shortwave broadcast
stations.  
<P>
<strong>Radios:</strong> This entry gives the total number of radio receivers.  
<P>

parts by gauge: broad, dual, narrow, standard, and other.  
<P>
<strong>Reference maps:</strong> This section includes world, regional, and special or current interest
maps.   
<P>
<strong>Religions:</strong> This entry includes a rank ordering of religions starting with the largest
and sometimes includes the percent of total population.  
<P>
<strong>Sex ratio:</strong> This entry includes the number of males for each female in five age
groups-at birth, under 15 years, 15-64 years, 65 years and over, and for the
total population. Sex ratio at birth has recently emerged as an indicator
of certain kinds of sex discrimination in some countries. For instance, high
sex ratios at birth in some Asian countries are now attributed to sex-selective
abortion and infanticide due to a strong preference for sons. This will affect
future marriage patterns and fertility patterns and could cause unrest among
young adult males who are unable to find partners. The sex ratio at birth
for the World is 1.06 (1997 est.).  
<P>
<strong>Suffrage:</strong> This entry gives the age at enfranchisement and whether the right to
vote is universal or restricted.  
<P>
<strong>Telephone numbers:</strong> All telephone numbers in the Factbook consist of the country code in
brackets, the city or area code (where required) in parentheses, and the local
number. The one component that is not presented is the international access
code which varies from country to country. For example, an international direct
dial telephone call placed from the US to Madrid, Spain, would be as follows:
 
<P>011 [34] (1) 577-xxxx where  
<br>011 is the international access code for station-to-station calls  

<br>(01 is for calls other than station-to-station calls),  
<br>[34] is the country code for Spain,  
<br>(1) is the city code for Madrid,  
<br>577 is the local exchange, and  
<br>xxxx is the local telephone number.  
<P>An international direct dial telephone call placed from another country
to the US would be as follows:  
<P>An international direct dial telephone call placed from another country
to the US would be as follows:  
<P>[1] is the country code for the US,  
<br>(202) is the area code for Washington, DC,  
<br>939 is the local exchange, and  
<br>xxxx is the local telephone number.

<strong>Television broadcast stations:</strong> This entry gives the total number of separate broadcast stations plus
any repeater stations.  
<P>
<strong>Televisions:</strong> This entry gives the total number of television sets.  
<P>
<strong>Terminology:</strong> Due to the highly structured nature of the Factbook database, some collective
generic terms have to be used. "Country name" and "National capital", for
example are used collectively to include nations, dependent areas, uninhabited
islands, areas of special sovereignty, etc. The term "Military" is also used
as an umbrella term for various civil defense, security, and defense activities.
 
<P>
<strong>Terrain:</strong> This entry contains a brief description of the topography.  
<P>
<strong>Total fertility rate:</strong> This entry gives a figure for the average number of children that would
be born per woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing years
and bore children according to a given fertility rate at each age. The total
fertility rate is a more direct measure of the level of fertility than the
crude birth rate, since it refers to births per woman. This indicator shows
the potential for population growth in the country. High rates will also place
some limits on the labor force participation rates for women. Large numbers
of children born to women indicate large family sizes that might limit the
capacity of the families to educate their children.  
<P>
