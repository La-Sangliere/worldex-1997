<b>Economy - overview:</b> Singapore has an open economy with strong service and manufacturing
sectors and excellent international trading links derived from its entrepot
history. A slump in global demand for electronics slowed Singapore's export
growth in 1996, and as a result, real GDP grew 6.5%, down from 8.9% in 1995.
The government predicts growth will be in the 5%-7% range in 1997. Rising
labor costs continue to be a threat to Singapore's competitiveness, and the
government's strategy to address this problem includes increasing productivity,
improving infrastructure, and encouraging higher value-added industries. In
applied technology, per capita output, investment, and labor discipline, Singapore
has key attributes of a developed country.
