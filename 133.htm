<p>
<b>Economy - overview:</b> Since 1993, the government of Kenya has implemented a program of economic
liberalization and reform. Steps have included the removal of import licensing
and price controls, removal of foreign exchange controls, fiscal and monetary
restraint, and reduction of the public sector through privatization of publicly
owned companies and downsizing the civil service. With the support of the
World Bank, IMF, and other donors, these reforms have led to a turnaround
in economic performance following a period of negative growth in the early
1990s. Kenya's real GDP grew at 5% in 1995 and 4% in 1996, and inflation remained
under control. Substantial barriers to growth and development remain, including
electricity shortages, the government's continued and inefficient dominance
of key sectors, endemic corruption, and the country's high population growth
rate (which has declined substantially in recent years).
