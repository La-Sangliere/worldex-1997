<b>Economy - overview:</b> The economy benefits substantially from financial assistance from the
US. The rate of funding has declined as locally generated government revenues
have grown. An agreement for the years 1986 to 1992 entitled the islands to
$228 million for capital development, government operations, and special programs.
Since 1992, funding has been extended one year at a time. The commonwealth
received $27.7 million from FY93/94 through FY95/96. For FY96/97 through FY02/03,
funding of $11 million will be provided for infrastructure, with an equal
local match. A rapidly growing major source of income is the tourist industry,
which now employs about 50% of the work force. Japanese tourists predominate.
The agricultural sector is of minor importance and is made up of cattle ranches
and small farms producing coconuts, breadfruit, tomatoes, and melons. Industry
is small scale, mostly handicrafts, light manufacturing, and garment production.
