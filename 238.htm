<p>
<b>Economy - overview:</b> One of the more advanced developing countries in Asia, Thailand depends
on exports of manufactures - including high-technology goods - and the development
of the service sector to fuel the country's rapid growth, averaging 9% since
1989. Most of Thailand's recent imports have been for capital equipment and
raw materials, although imports of consumer goods are beginning to rise. Thailand's
35% domestic savings rate is a key source of capital for the economy, and
the country is also benefiting from rising investment from abroad. Prime Minister
CHAWALIT's government - Thailand's seventh government in six years - will
continue Bangkok's probusiness policies and reemphasize Bangkok's traditional
fiscal austerity. CHAWALIT is beginning to address Thailand's serious infrastructure
bottlenecks, especially in the transport and telecommunications sectors. Over
the longer term, Bangkok must produce more college graduates with technical
training and upgrade workers' skills to continue its rapid economic development.
