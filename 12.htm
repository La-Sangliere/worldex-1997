<b>Economy - overview:</b> Tourism continues to be by far the dominant activity in the economy
but the combined share in GDP of transport and communications, trade, and
public utilities has increased markedly in recent years. Tourism's direct
contribution to output in 1994 was about 20%. In addition, increased tourist
arrivals helped spur growth in the construction and transport sectors. The
dual island nation's agricultural production is mainly directed to the domestic
market; the sector is constrained by the limited water supply and labor shortages
that reflect the pull of higher wages in tourism and construction. Manufacturing
comprises enclave-type assembly for export with major products being bedding,
handicrafts, and electronic components. Prospects for economic growth in the
medium term will continue to depend on income growth in the industrialized
world, especially in the US, which accounts for about half of all tourist
arrivals.
