the only internationally recognized government; on 15 November 1983 Turkish
Cypriot "President" Rauf DENKTASH declared independence and the formation
of a "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" (TRNC), which has been recognized

<p>
<b>Economy - overview:</b> The Greek Cypriot economy is small and prosperous, but highly susceptible
to external shocks. Industry contributes 23% to GDP and employs 25% of the
labor force, while the service sector contributes 72% to GDP and employs 62%
of the labor force. Erratic growth rates in the 1990s reflect the economy's
vulnerability to swings in tourist arrivals (caused by fluctuations in political
and economic conditions in Western Europe and the Middle East) and the need
for structural changes in the economy. One bright spot has been the low rate
of inflation. In 1996 Cyprus fully satisfied all the Maastricht convergence
criteria. The Turkish Cypriot economy has less than one-third the per capita
GDP of the south. Because it is recognized only by Turkey, it has had much
difficulty arranging foreign financing, and foreign firms have hesitated to
invest there. The economy remains heavily dependent on agriculture and government
service, which together employ about half of the work force. Moreover, the
small, vulnerable economy has suffered because the Turkish lira is legal tender.
To compensate for the economy's weakness, Turkey provides direct and indirect
aid to nearly every sector. In January 1997, Turkey signed a $250 million
economic cooperation accord with the Turkish Cypriot area to support tourism,
education, and industry.
