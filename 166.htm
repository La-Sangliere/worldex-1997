<b>Economy - overview:</b> Moldova enjoys a favorable climate and good farmland but has no major
mineral deposits. As a result, the economy depends heavily on agriculture,
 featuring fruits, vegetables, wine, and tobacco. Moldova must import all
of its supplies of oil, coal, and natural gas, largely from Russia. Energy
shortages contributed to sharp production declines after the breakup of the
Soviet Union in 1991. The Moldovan Government has recently been making progress
on an ambitious economic reform agenda, and the IMF has called Moldova a model
for the region. As part of its reform efforts, Moldova introduced a stable
convertible currency, freed all prices, stopped issuing preferential credits
to state enterprises and backed their steady privatization, removed export
controls, and freed interest rates. With the election of President LUCINSCHI
in December 1996, it is unclear how rapidly the reforms will be pushed.
