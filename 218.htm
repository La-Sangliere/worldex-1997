<b>Economy - overview:</b> Sierra Leone has substantial mineral, agricultural, and fishery resources.
However, the economic and social infrastructure is not well developed, and
serious social disorders continue to hamper economic development. Agriculture
employs about two-thirds of the working population, with subsistence agriculture
dominating the sector. Manufacturing consists mainly of the processing of
raw materials and of light manufacturing for the domestic market. The mining
of diamonds, bauxite, and rutile is the major source of hard currency. The
government has worked hard to meet its IMF- and World Bank-mandated stabilization
targets, holding down fiscal deficits and retiring much of its domestic debt,
but at a steep cost in terms of forgone capital investments and social spending.
Moreover, the economic infrastructure has nearly collapsed due to neglect
and war-related disruptions in the mining and agricultural export sectors.
The continuing civil war in Liberia has led to a large influx of refugees,
who place additional burdens on Sierra Leone's fragile economy.
