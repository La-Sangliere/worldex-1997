<b>Current issues:</b> On 21 November 1995, in Dayton, Ohio, the former Yugoslavia's three
warring parties signed a peace agreement that brought to a halt over three
years of interethnic civil strife in Bosnia and Herzegovina (the final agreement
was signed in Paris on 14 December 1995). The Dayton Agreement, signed by
Bosnian President IZETBEGOVIC, Croatian President TUDJMAN, and Serbian President
MILOSEVIC, divides Bosnia and Herzegovina roughly equally between the Muslim/Croat
Federation and the Bosnian Serbs while maintaining Bosnia's currently recognized
borders. In 1995-96, a NATO-led international peacekeeping force (IFOR) of
60,000 troops served in Bosnia to implement and monitor the military aspects
of the agreement. IFOR was succeeded by a smaller, NATO-led Stabilization
Force (SFOR) whose mission is to deter renewed hostilities. SFOR will remain
in place until June 1998. A High Representative appointed by the UN Security
Council is responsible for civilian implementation of the accord, including
monitoring implementation, facilitating any difficulties arising in connection
with civilian implementation, and coordinating activities of the civilian
organizations and agencies in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Bosnian conflict
began in the spring of 1992 when the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina
held a referendum on independence and the Bosnian Serbs - supported by neighboring
Serbia - responded with armed resistance aimed at partitioning the republic
along ethnic lines and joining Serb-held areas to form a "greater Serbia."
 In March 1994, Bosnia's Muslims and Croats reduced the number of warring
factions from three to two by signing an agreement in Washington creating
their joint Muslim/Croat Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Federation,
formed by the Muslims and Croats in March 1994, is one of two entities (the
other being the Bosnian Serb-led Republika Srpska) that comprise Bosnia and
Herzegovina.

<b>Government - note:</b> Until declaring independence in spring 1992, Bosnia and Herzegovina
existed as a republic in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Bosnia was partitioned
by fighting during 1992-95 and governed by competing ethnic factions. Bosnia's
current governing structures were created by the Dayton Accords, the 1995
peace agreement which was officially signed in Paris on 14 December 1995 by
Bosnian President IZETBEGOVIC, Croatian President TUDJMAN, and Serbian President
MILOSEVIC. This agreement retained Bosnia's exterior border and created a
joint multi-ethnic and democratic government. This national government - based
on proportional representation similar to that which existed in the former
socialist regime - is charged with conducting foreign, economic, and fiscal
policy. The Dayton Accords also recognized a second tier of government, comprised
of two entities - a joint Muslim-Croat Federation and the Bosnian Serb Republika
Srpska (RS) - each presiding over roughly one-half the territory. These Federation
and RS governments are charged with overseeing internal functions. As mandated
by the Dayton Accords, the Bosnians on 14 September 1996 participated in the
first post-war elections of national, entity, and cantonal leaders. The Bosnians
have been slow to form and install new joint institutions. A new Federation
cabinet was sworn in 18 December 1996 and the new Bosnian central government
cabinet was confirmed on 3 January 1997.

<b>Economy - overview:</b> Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to The Former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia as the poorest republic in the old Yugoslav federation. Although
agriculture has been almost all in private hands, farms have been small and
inefficient, and the republic traditionally has been a net importer of food.
Industry has been greatly overstaffed, one reflection of the rigidities of
communist central planning and management. TITO had pushed the development
of military industries in the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted
a large share of Yugoslavia's defense plants. The bitter interethnic warfare
in Bosnia caused production to plummet by perhaps 90% since 1990, unemployment
to soar, and human misery to multiply. No reliable economic statistics for
1992-96 are available, although output almost certainly is well below $1,000
per head. In the Federation, unemployment remains in the 40%-50% range and
inflation is low. By contrast, growth in the Republika Srpska in 1996 was
flat and inflation surpassed 30%. The country receives substantial amounts
of humanitarian aid from the international community. Wide regional differences
in war damage and access to the outside world have resulted in substantial
variations in living conditions among local areas.
