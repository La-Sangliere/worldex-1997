<b>Economy - overview:</b> Romania, one of the poorer countries in Central and Eastern Europe,
began the transition from Communism with a largely obsolete industrial base
and a pattern of output unsuited to the country's needs. Over the past seven
years, economic restructuring has lagged behind most other countries in the
region. Consequently, economic performance is declining, with slowing GDP
growth, ballooning budget deficits, accelerating inflation, a plunging exchange
rate, and anemic foreign investment. Unemployment was low at about 6% at the
end of 1996, but the rate will rise when restructuring gets underway. A new
government elected in November 1996 promises to accelerate economic reform,
restructuring, and privatization, introduce fiscal and monetary austerity,
reduce the state's role in the economy, and open Romania to foreign investment.
The government will tackle its formidable economic problems in two stages,
with an emergency plan over the winter of 1996/97 to ensure social and political
stability, followed by a radical structural reform program over its remaining
three-and-one-half years aimed eventually at EU accession. At the same time,
it wants to keep campaign promises to increase benefits to disadvantaged groups.
Bucharest hopes to receive financial and technical assistance from international
financial institutions and western governments and negotiations over a new
IMF standby agreement are underway. If reform stalls, however, Romania's bond
rating - just below investment grade - could fall and needed capital from
both public and private sources could quickly dry up. Rich agricultural and
oil resources are strengths for the future.
