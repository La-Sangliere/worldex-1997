<b>Economy - overview:</b> Norway is a prosperous bastion of welfare capitalism. The economy consists
of a combination of free market activity and government intervention. The
government controls key areas, such as the vital petroleum sector (through
large-scale state enterprises), and extensively subsidizes agriculture, fishing,
and areas with sparse resources. Norway maintains an extensive welfare system
that helps propel public sector expenditures to more than 50% of GDP and results
in one of the highest average tax levels in the world (46%). A small country
with a high dependence on international trade, Norway is basically an exporter
of raw materials and semiprocessed goods, with an abundance of small- and
medium-sized firms, and is ranked among the major shipping nations. The country
is richly endowed with natural resources - petroleum, hydropower, fish, forests,
and minerals - and is highly dependent on its oil sector. Only Saudi Arabia
exports more oil than Norway. Norway imports more than half its food needs.
Economic growth, only 1.6% in 1993, has improved steadily over the past few
years, resulting in a budget surplus in 1996. Oslo opted to stay out of the
EU during a referendum in November 1994. Despite their high per capita income
- outstripped among major nations only by the US - and their generous welfare
benefits, the Norwegians worry about that time in the 21st century when the
oil and gas run out.
