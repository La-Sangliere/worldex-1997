<b>Economy - overview:</b> Economic activity consists primarily of subsistence farming and fishing.
The islands have few mineral deposits worth exploiting, except for high-grade
phosphate. The potential for a tourist industry exists, but the remoteness
of the location and a lack of adequate facilities hinder development. Financial
assistance from the US is the primary source of revenue, with the US pledged
to spend $1 billion in the islands in the 1990s. Geographical isolation and
a poorly developed infrastructure are major impediments to long-term growth.
