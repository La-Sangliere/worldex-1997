<b>Current issues:</b> Tajikistan has experienced three changes of government since it gained
independence in September 1991. The current president, Emomali RAHMONOV, was
elected in November 1994, yet has been in power since 1992. The country is
suffering through its fourth year of a civil conflict, with no clear end in
sight. Underlying the conflict are deeply rooted regional and clan-based 
animosities that pit a government consisting of people primarily from the
Kulob (Kulyab), Khujand (Leninabad), and Hisor (Hissar) regions against a
secular and Islamic-led opposition from the Gharm, Gorno-Badakhshan, and Qurghonteppa
(Kurgan-Tyube) regions. Government and opposition representatives have held
periodic rounds of UN-mediated peace talks and agreed in September 1994 to
a cease-fire which has been periodically extended. Russian-led peacekeeping
troops are deployed throughout the country, and Russian-commanded border guards
are stationed along the Tajikistani-Afghan border.

<b>Economy - overview:</b> Tajikistan had the next-to-lowest per capita GDP in the former USSR,
the highest rate of population growth, an extremely low standard of living,
and rampant inflation. Agriculture dominates the economy, with cotton being
the most important crop. Mineral resources, varied but limited in amount,
include silver, gold, uranium, and tungsten. Industry is limited to a large
aluminum plant, hydropower facilities, and small obsolete factories mostly
in light industry and food processing. The Tajik economy has been gravely
 weakened by four years of civil conflict and by the loss of subsidies from
Moscow and of markets for its products, which has left Tajikistan dependent
on Russia and Uzbekistan and on international humanitarian assistance for
much of its basic subsistence needs. Moreover, constant political turmoil
and the continued dominance by former communist officials have impeded the
 introduction of meaningful economic reforms. The regime made initial efforts
to stabilize the economy and promote reform in 1996.
