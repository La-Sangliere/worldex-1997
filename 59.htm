<p>
<b>Economy - overview:</b> One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is made up of three islands
that have inadequate transportation links, a young and rapidly increasing
population, and few natural resources. The low educational level of the labor
force contributes to a subsistence level of economic activity, high unemployment,
and a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical assistance. Agriculture,
including fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the leading sector of the economy.
It contributes nearly 40% to GDP, employs 80% of the labor force, and provides
most of the exports. The country is not self-sufficient in food production;
rice, the main staple, accounts for the bulk of imports. The government is
struggling to upgrade education and technical training, to privatize commercial
and industrial enterprises, to improve health services, to diversify exports,
to promote tourism, and to reduce the high population growth rate. Continued
foreign support is essential if the goal of 4% annual GDP growth is to be
reached in the late 1990s.
