<b>Economy - overview:</b> The socialist-oriented economy depends primarily upon revenues from
the oil sector, which contributes practically all export earnings and about
one-third of GDP. In 1990 per capita GDP was the highest in Africa at $5,410,
but subsequently GDP growth has slowed on average and has fluctuated sharply
in response to changes in the world oil market. Import restrictions and inefficient
resource allocations have led to periodic shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs.
The nonoil manufacturing and construction sectors, which account for about
20% of GDP, have expanded from processing mostly agricultural products to
include the production of petrochemicals, iron, steel, and aluminum. Although
agriculture accounts for only 5% of GDP, it employs 18% of the labor force.
Climatic conditions and poor soils severely limit farm output, and Libya imports
about 75% of its food requirements. The UN sanctions imposed in April 1992
have not yet had a major impact on the economy because Libya's oil revenues
generate sufficient foreign exchange to sustain imports of food, consumer
goods, and equipment for the oil industry and ongoing development projects.
