<b>Economy - overview:</b> With its long history of semifeudal social controls, dependence on volatile
prices for its mineral exports, and bouts of hyperinflation, Bolivia has remained
one of the poorest and least developed Latin American countries. However,
Bolivia has experienced generally improving economic conditions since the
PAZ Estenssoro administration (1985-89) introduced market-oriented policies
which reduced inflation from 11,700% in 1985 to about 20% in 1988. PAZ Estenssoro
was followed as president by Jaime PAZ Zamora (1989-93) who continued the
free-market policies of his predecessor, despite opposition from his own party
and from Bolivia's once powerful labor movement. By maintaining fiscal discipline,
PAZ Zamora helped reduce inflation to 9.3% in 1993, while GDP grew by an annual
average of 3.25% during his tenure. Inaugurated in August 1993, President
SANCHEZ DE LOZADA has vowed to advance the market-oriented economic reforms
he helped launch as PAZ Estenssoro's planning minister. His successes include
the signing of a free trade agreement with Mexico and the Southern Cone Common
Market (Mercosur) as well as the privatization of the state airline, phone
 company, railroad, electric power company, and oil company. Furthermore,
SANCHEZ DE LOZADA sponsored legislation creating private social security accounts
for all adult Bolivians and capitalized these new accounts with the state's
remaining 50% share in the privatized companies.
