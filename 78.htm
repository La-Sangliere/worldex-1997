<b>Historical perspective:</b> on 29 May 1991, ISAIAS Afworke, secretary general of the Peoples' Front
for Democracy and Justice (PFDJ), which then served as the country's legislative
body, announced the formation of the Provisional Government in Eritrea (PGE)
in preparation for the 23-25 April 1993 referendum on independence for the
Autonomous Region of Eritrea; the referendum resulted in a landslide vote
for independence which was proclaimed on 27 April 1993

<b>Economy - overview:</b> With independence from Ethiopia on 27 April 1993, Eritrea faced the
bitter economic problems of a small, desperately poor African country. Most
of the population must continue to depend on subsistence farming. Domestic
output (GDP) is substantially augmented by worker remittances from abroad.
Government revenues come from custom duties and income and sales taxes. Road
construction is a top domestic priority. Shortages persist in housing, education,
and health care. Eritrea has inherited the entire coastline of Ethiopia and
has long-term prospects for revenues from the development of offshore oil,
offshore fishing, and tourism. Ethiopia is largely dependent on Eritrean ports
for its foreign commerce.
