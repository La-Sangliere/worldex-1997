<b>Economy - overview:</b> Like other South Pacific island nations, the Cook Islands' economic
development is hindered by the isolation of the country from foreign markets,
lack of natural resources, periodic devastation from natural disasters, and
inadequate infrastructure. Agriculture provides the economic base with major
exports made up of copra and citrus fruit. Manufacturing activities are limited
to a fruit-processing plant and several clothing factories. Trade deficits
are made up for by remittances from emigrants and by foreign aid, largely
from New Zealand. In 1996, the government declared bankruptcy, citing a $120
million public debt. Efforts to exploit tourism potential and expanding the
mining and fishing industries have not been enough to adequately deal with
the financial crisis. In an effort to stem further erosion of the tenuous
economic situation, the government slashed public service salaries by 50%,
condensed the number of government ministries from 52 to 22, reduced the number
of civil servants by more than half, began selling government assets, and
closed all overseas diplomatic posts except for the one in New Zealand.
