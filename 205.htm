<b>Economy - overview:</b> Russia, a vast country with a wealth of natural resources, a well-educated
population, and a diverse, but declining, industrial base, continues to experience
formidable difficulties in moving from its old centrally planned economy to
a modern market economy. Most of 1996 was a lost year for economic reforms,
with government officials focused in the first half of the year on President
YEL'TSIN's reelection and then on his medical problems. The only major success
was in the fight against inflation, which fell from 131% in 1995 to 22% in
1996. Russia failed to make any progress in restructuring its social welfare
programs to target the most needy - among whom are many of the old pensioners
- or to pass needed tax reform. While approximately 75% of industry has now
been privatized, the agricultural sector has undergone little reform since
the break-up of the Soviet Union. Stockholder rights remain weak while crime
and corruption are rampant in much of the economy. Many enterprises continue
to operate without hard budget constraints, resulting in barter trade and
increased inter-enterprise debts. According to official statistics, the Russian
 economy declined for the fifth straight year since the beginning of reforms,
with GDP in 1996 falling by 6% and industrial output by 5%. The true size
of the Russian economy remains controversial, however, with estimates of unreported
economic activity ranging from 20%-50% of GDP. Indeed, according to Russian
statistics, the Russian consumer has seen a small improvement in the last
several years, with real average incomes growing by about 8% from early 1993
to late 1996. The share of the Russian population living below the poverty
line is said to have dropped from one-third in early 1993 to one-fifth in
late 1996. Few Russians lack basic necessities, and ownership of consumer
goods such as VCRs and automobiles has increased markedly. The growth of wage
and pension arrears slowed in the second half of 1996, and the government
pledged to clear all budget-funded wage and pension arrears by the end of
1997. The government continued to be plagued with tax collection problems
during 1996, forcing it to cut its planned spending by 18%. A crackdown on
major tax debtors at the end of the year had only limited success. Spending
by all levels of government remains high, between 40%-45% of GDP. The economy
is continuing its integration into world markets. Russia's trade surplus,
after adjustment for unreported "shuttle" trade, grew to a record $28.5 billion
 in 1996, according to official Russian statistics. Export growth, which slowed
from 18% to 9%, was due mostly to increased raw material prices. After increasing
by 15% in 1995, imports dipped by 2% in 1996 as Russian demand for Western
consumer goods slackened. Russia is continuing to make progress in its WTrO
negotiations; the government has made quick accession one of its major policy
goals. The continued unsettled economic and political situation has discouraged
foreign investment, which totaled only $6.5 billion in 1996, including $2.1
billion in direct investment; furthermore, capital flight continues to exceed
in volume the inflow of foreign capital. The central bank estimates that $30
billion in US currency circulates in the Russian economy. In March 1997, YEL'TSIN
signaled his intention to restart stalled economic reforms by reorganizing
the cabinet, bringing in a new team of ministers with strong reform credentials.
