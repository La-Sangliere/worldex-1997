<b>Location:</b> body of water between Africa, Antarctica, Asia, and Australia 

<p>
<b>Geographic coordinates:</b> 30 00 S, 80 00 E 

<p>
<b>Map references:</b> World 

<p>
<b>Area:</b> 
<br><i>total :</i> 73.6 million sq km 
<br><i>note:</i> includes Arabian Sea, Bass Straight, Bay of Bengal, Great Australian
Bight, Gulf of Oman, Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Strait of Malacca, and other tributary
water bodies 

<p>
<b>Area - comparative:</b> slightly less than eight times the size of the US; third-largest ocean
(after the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean, but larger than the Arctic Ocean) 


<p>
<b>Coastline:</b> 66,526 km 

<p>
<b>Climate:</b> northeast monsoon (December to April), southwest monsoon (June to October);
tropical cyclones occur during May/June and October/November in the northern
Indian Ocean and January/February in the southern Indian Ocean

<p>
<b>Terrain:</b> surface dominated by counterclockwise gyre (broad, circular system of
currents) in the southern Indian Ocean; unique reversal of surface currents
 in the northern Indian Ocean; low atmospheric pressure over southwest Asia
from hot, rising, summer air results in the southwest monsoon and southwest-to-northeast
winds and currents, while high pressure over northern Asia from cold, falling,
winter air results in the northeast monsoon and northeast-to-southwest winds
and currents; ocean floor is dominated by the Mid-Indian Ocean Ridge and subdivided
by the Southeast Indian Ocean Ridge, Southwest Indian Ocean Ridge, and Ninety
East Ridge

<p>
<b>Elevation extremes:</b> 
<br><i>lowest point:</i> Java Trench -7,258 m 
<br><i>highest point:</i> sea level 0 m 

<p>
<b>Natural resources:</b> oil and gas fields, fish, shrimp, sand and gravel aggregates, placer
deposits, polymetallic nodules 

<p>
<b>Natural hazards:</b> ships subject to superstructure icing in extreme south near Antarctica
from May to October

<p>
<b>Environment - current issues:</b> endangered marine species include the dugong, seals, turtles, and whales;
oil pollution in the Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf, and Red Sea

<p>
<b>Environment - international agreements:</b> 
<br><i>party to :</i> none of the selected agreements
<br><i>signed, but not ratified:</i> none of the selected agreements

<p>
<b>Geography - note:</b> major chokepoints include Bab el Mandeb, Strait of Hormuz, Strait of
Malacca, southern access to the Suez Canal, and the Lombok Strait

<b>Economy - overview:</b> The Indian Ocean provides major sea routes connecting the Middle East,
Africa, and East Asia with Europe and the Americas. It carries a particularly
heavy traffic of petroleum and petroleum products from the oilfields of the
Persian Gulf and Indonesia. Its fish are of great and growing importance to
the bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing fleets
from Russia, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly
for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are being tapped in the
offshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and western Australia. An estimated
40% of the world's offshore oil production comes from the Indian Ocean. Beach
sands rich in heavy minerals and offshore placer deposits are actively exploited
by bordering countries, particularly India, South Africa, Indonesia, Sri Lanka,
and Thailand.
