<b>Economy - overview:</b> As one of the Four Dragons of East Asia, South Korea has achieved an
incredible record of growth. Three decades ago its GDP per capita was comparable
with levels in the poorer countries of Africa and Asia. Today its GDP per
capita is eight times India's, 15 times North Korea's, and already up with
the lesser economies of the European Union. This success has been achieved
by a unique system of guidance by an authoritarian government of what is essentially
an entrepreneurial process. The government has sponsored large-scale adoption
of technology and management from Japan and other modern nations; has successfully
pushed the development of export industries while encouraging the import of
machinery and materials at the expense of consumer goods; and has pushed its
labor force to a work effort seldom matched anywhere even in wartime. Real
GDP grew by an average 10% in 1986-91, then paused to a "mere" 5% in 1992-93,
moved back up to 8% in 1994 and 9% in 1995, and about 7% in 1996. With a much
higher standard of living and with a considerable easing of authoritarian
controls, the work pace has softened. Growth rates will probably slow down
over the medium term.
