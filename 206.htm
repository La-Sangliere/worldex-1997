<b>Current issues:</b> following the outbreak of genocidal strife in Rwanda in April 1994 between
Tutsi and Hutu factions, more than 2 million refugees fled to neighboring
Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda and Democratic Republic of the Congo, formerly Zaire;
according to the UN High Commission on Refugees, in 1996 and early 1997 nearly
1,300,000 Hutus returned to Rwanda; of these, 720,000 returned from Zaire,

<b>Economy - overview:</b> Rwanda is a poor African nation suffering bitterly from ethnic-based
civil war. The agricultural sector dominates the economy; coffee and tea normally
make up 80%-90% of exports. The amount of fertile land is limited, however,
and deforestation and soil erosion continue to reduce the production potential.
Manufacturing focuses mainly on the processing of agricultural products. A
structural adjustment program with the World Bank began in October 1990. Ethnic-based
insurgency since 1990 has devastated wide areas, especially in the north,
and displaced hundreds of thousands of people. A peace accord in mid-1993
temporarily ended most of the fighting, but resumption of large-scale civil
warfare in April 1994 in the capital city Kigali and elsewhere took 500,000
lives in that year alone and severely damaged already poor economic prospects.
Sketchy data suggest that GDP dropped 50% in 1994 and came back partially,
by 25%, in 1995. Plentiful rains helped agriculture in 1996, and outside aid
continued to support this desperately poor economy. The economy continues
to suffer massively from failure to maintain the infrastructure, looting,
neglect of important cash crops, and lack of health care facilities. Because
of the accumulated damage to capital plant and the decline in public discipline,
recovery of domestic production will proceed slowly.
