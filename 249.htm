<b>Economy - overview:</b> Uganda has substantial natural resources, including fertile soils, regular
rainfall, and sizable mineral deposits of copper and cobalt. Agriculture is
the most important sector of the economy, employing over 80% of the work force.
Coffee is the major export crop and accounts for the bulk of export revenues.
Since 1986 the government - with the support of foreign countries and international
agencies - has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking
currency reform, raising producer prices on export crops, increasing prices
of petroleum products, and improving civil service wages. The policy changes
are especially aimed at dampening inflation and boosting production and export
earnings. In 1990-94, the economy turned in a solid performance based on continued
investment in the rehabilitation of infrastructure, improved incentives for
production and exports, and gradually improving domestic security. The economy
again prospered in 1995 with rapid growth, low inflation, growing foreign
investment, a trimmed bureaucracy, and the continued return of exiled Indian-Ugandan
entrepreneurs.
