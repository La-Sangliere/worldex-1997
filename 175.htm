<b>Economy - overview:</b> Nepal is among the poorest and least developed countries in the world
with about 60% of the population living below the poverty line. Agriculture
is the mainstay of the economy, providing a livelihood for over 80% of the
population and accounting for more than 40% of GDP. Industrial activity is
limited, mainly involving the processing of agricultural produce including
jute, sugarcane, tobacco, and grain. Production of textiles and carpets has
 expanded recently and accounted for about 80% of foreign exchange earnings
in the past two years. Apart from agricultural land and forests, exploitable
natural resources are mica, hydropower, and tourism. Agricultural production
is growing about 5% on average as compared with annual population growth of
2.5%. Since May 1991, the government has been moving forward with economic
reforms particularly those that encourage trade and foreign investment, e.g.,
by eliminating business licenses and registration requirements in order to
simplify investment procedures. The government has also been cutting expenditures
by reducing subsidies, privatizing state industries, and laying off civil
servants. The government made some progress in 1996, signing trade agreements
with countries including India, and attracting substantial foreign investment
in hydropower. Prospects for foreign trade and investment in areas besides
hydropower and tourism will continue to remain poor because of the small size
of the economy, its technological backwardness, its remoteness, and its landlocked
geographic location highly susceptible to natural disaster. The international
community provides funding for more than 60% of Nepal's development budget
and more than 30% of total budgetary expenditures.
